The lobby has photos of Winston Churchill and others staying here. The air conditioning worked well and we both slept well. The room was clean but the bathroom desperately needs renovation. The hotel’s critical weakness is the dire quality of the buffet food for breakfast and dinner. The only highlight was the omelet station in the mornings. This hotel cannot thrive with western tourists until the food improves.,Al-Fayyum

We had an enormous room with4 beds in it and everything was clean and comfortable. We struggled to get hot water in the bathroom, but this seems a common problem in Egypt. The hotel has attractive gardens with plenty of seating areas and a nice pool. There are several friendly cats and dogs who are willing to share the plentiful, tasty meals with visitors, but are in no way a nuisance. Situated right in the heart of Tunis village, there is easy access to local artisan workshops, ATMs and supermarkets.",Al-Fayyum

We ordered ducks and pigeons. The order took an hour and 20 minutes. You’d think it was worth the wait, nope. The duck was tasteless and very hard to chew, while the pigeons were a total disaster. They were barely cooked and each one was still bloody. Imagine my feeling when trying to reach the stuffed rice only to find the blood. Simply disgusting, I stopped myself from vomiting. We paid 2800 for this raw crap. Sorry Zad El Mosafer you’ve wasted ALL your Chances. NEVER AGAIN.",Al-Fayyum
