Then he told me it was because two people where sleeping in the one room. Yet on the Expedia website we had paid for 2 people sleeping in the one room. At reception they made me feel belittled.

I explained I wouldn’t be given them anymore for Expedia mistakes that they needed to take it up with them! Even after I showed the hotel that I had paid the correct balance, they still wanted more from me. After an hour of standing at reception a man came along and explained it was not my fault and they had to take it up with h Expedia directly we where given a room. The was dirty. The bin was full and the lights didn’t work in the room. We had travelled by bus from Giza to Alexandria for Eid celebrations, we where tired. Yet the directions to hotel when we booked said 2 meter walk into main Alexandria. It was miles away from Alexandria!!!  We both decided after the treatment we had at reception and the dirty state of the room to just get in a taxis and not stay in this hotel. So we took our suitcases back down stairs and I explained we wouldn’t be staying due to the treatment we received and due to room being extremely dirty. They just looked at me and said ok, but you will not get a refund for the room.  Completely disappointed about this hotel and I will never be back or recommend it! We got into a beautiful hotel in the centre of Alexandria and they treated us like Queens. …",Alexandria
