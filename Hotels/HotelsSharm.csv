We were promised wifi and I paid for a certain level of accomodations.  Instead they only had wifi in the lobbies (you can only check in and out in one, the rest are purely decorative and for saying ""go to the main lobby""), but in the rooms there was none, and I had to buy a local sim in the hotel store. The owner of the shop sold 2 sims- to me and my brother, one of them didn't work, but the owner didn't admit to a thing.  Door was constantly getting stuck and the sink drain didn't work. Sink was fixed on the same day, the door- on day 4.   Cleaning: they mop the floor, but don't change the sheets- the staff just turned them over. I know because it was the same stain.   Food: Acceptable. Not wow, acceptable. Some plates and cups were chipped and cutlery was filthy.  On day 3 we were offered a compensation dinner in one of the a-la-carte restauraunts. I was told it was for the repairs. When I was offered to sign a waver, I saw that it was for a DOWNGRADE of the room I was NOT notified of. Too bad I read what I sign.   But I'm the forgiving type. So I decided to pretend it's acceptable. We went to the dinner- and 2 out our party of 6 got food poisoning.  Mosquitoes. But no nets or zappers. And no spraying or any other measures taken. Luckily I brought repellent from home.   Kids club- another promised feature. About 3 square meters and no AC in airtight room. Saunas aren't safe in this age, just so you know.   The airport is nearby. Either the windows are shut completely, or you don't sleep that night.   On the bright side, the garden is lovely, the beach is clean and the aquapark is perfect- clean, well staffed, safe.   In summary: lots of things to improve, but I guess it could be worse...…"

And we could feel the difference after all Summit guests were gone.   What was fabulous during our stay: animation team! They were really a highlight duringour stay! We have celebrated a birthday of my 4 year old daughter during our stay and animation team and russian speaking manager of the hotel done a really great job to make us feel festive! They have decorated our room as a piece of art, baked the cake, brought it to our room and in the evening after the mini disco the Event manager made a great little happy birthday party for our daughter! Couldnt celebrate better than that and I would say million thanks to Amira, Margarita, Ahmed and other animators for being so warm, welcoming and nice to us!! We will remember this day! Thank you thank you thank you! you've done a really great job! The fire show was also a blast!! Mini disco every day at 20.30 folowing some sort of show for adults like fire show or belly dance.   Beach was nice and The sea is beautiful! This is definately a must see! The shuttle from the hotel goes every hour but you can walk about 15 mins to the beach yourself to get some excercise. We've done that every day. The path is easy but lots of rubbish in the area. I wonder why the hotels dont make their staff to clean not only inside of the hotel but also around it. Animation team could come to the beach more often to spend some time with guests doing zumba and playing volleyball. We have seen them only once for 1 day and they said there were not enough animators.  The Restaurant. First few days was fab. After that it was a mess. Salty soup for 3 days, salty fish. This was a first time for me when I refuse to eat food in the restaurant. An improvement on the menu is needed. Loads of greens though, many fruits including fresh figs, strawberries, guavas, grape, apples, delicious dry plums, etc - this is a 5*. Food in first few days was amazing! Fresh grill outside, inside so many choices of food and everythng we've tried was delicious. After summit guests were gone there was no more vegetarian options. We had a 1 day dinner in the small Italian restaurant where the buffet was transfered due to a little amount of guetsts in the hotel and were offered to choose the main meal while the rest was in a buffet style. This was a disaster. So salty grilled fish and soup.. left hungry. The next day there was no food in the beach cafe. And we stayed hungry until the evening. And again salty soup in the evening.. Morning pancakes and waffles recepie needs improvement. Not tasty and cold, had to ask to make fresh for me every time but still took ages and was too dry due to the grill not heated enough and it took long time for panckaes to cook. Eggs and omelets were fab! Cereals sections needs no sugar addition like sugar free muesli. Music in the dining area is disturbing therefore we were eating outside the restaurant all the time. Beach cafe needs improvement as well. As they do french fries and chicken in advance, everything gets cold and this is served to the guestes. Evrything has to be made fresh including french fries. Staff over there doesn't do any other job than that. They just stare at the phones all the time and serve cold potatoes. Fruits are there thannks for that. First aid needs to be completed with scissors (they dont have them and plaster has been cut by the safe guard).   Staff is very friendly and helpful - this is a highlight. I've had a help wherever i go. But  they do require a bit more knowledge of english. And the guy that sells excursions in the hotel is very friendly (thank you) but super annoying.  Room was awesome! huge and bed, pillows were very comfy. View from the balcony was on the pool and mountains. Amazing! Everything you could possibly need is there: bottle of water for every person, coffee station, kettle, plenty of fresh towels. Cleaned every day.  Music from the pool area in the morning was amazing. Loved it! Quiet and peaceful. The 2 minus: staff needs training on how to wash floors - not good. And our hot water was yellow colour.…"

There is no reception on site. The security guard calls someone when you arrive. It’s really weird. They said that they would give my tour guide a refund and then because we didn’t change rooms they refused. So we ended up having to pay even though we had such a horrible experience.  We were ready to leave on the spot but couldn’t find another place to stay because we arrived so late. Do yourself a favor and read the reviews on booking.com. They may seem funny, but they are all very accurate. I’m not sure why most people made negative comments, but then gave a high rating. It makes no sense to me.

Jaz Sharm Dream Hotel Sharm Sharm El-Shaikh,5.0,,,,"למי שרוצה לבוא לשארם  בעיקר לשנרקל.  חזרנו בסוף אוקטובר מחופשת שנירקול בשארם.  להרבה מלונות יש שוניות צמודות, אבל לא רק ביקורות בטריפאדוויזר, אלא גם ובעיקר המיצרים ממליצים על החוף הציבורי  אום אל סיד ועל מלון ג'ז פאנארה Jaz fanara .  במלון אמרו לנו שישראלים נדירים שם. התרשמנו רוב האורחים במלון הם רוסים ואיטלקים. המלון יפה (ביחוד החדרים עם נוף לים), השירות מעולה (גם לפני שחילקנו שטרות של דולר על ימין ושמאל), המסעדה ממש ממש טובה ומגוונת, אבל אלו פרטים קטנים. עיקר החוויה הן השוניות היפיפיות ולהקות הדגים וחיות הים בשלל צבעים שנמתחות מחוף אום אלסיד ועד חוף פארשה הבדואי המקסים. אין לי אומדן כי הייתי רוב הזמן עם הראש במים אבל אני מעריך שזה שנירקול לאורך של כקילומטר (וכמובן אפשר פחות). היינו במלון חמישה ימים וביטלנו תכניות לשוט לטיראן ולנסוע לרס מוחמד (חלק מהשוניות מאוד דומות), כי רצינו להכיל את כל הטוב הזה. כן, אפשר גם לצלול. …"

Garden Reef Resort,2.0,,,,"Если вы едете в этот отель - будьте готовы к соотношению цена\качество. Отель дешевый, и обслуживание соответствует. Хамовитый персонал, очереди в столовке (назвать это рестораном язык не повернется). Бассейны грязные, стремноватые, хлоркой воняют. Зачем их закрывают в 17.00 - загадка, ни разу не видела, чтоб их чистили. Кофе в столовке - помои без всяких переносных смыслов. За грилем нужно стоять в очереди. Бывают фрукты, неплохие. Территория красивая. Выглядят бассейны шикарно (днем, ночью их не подсвечивают). Мест для фотографирования куча. Отдельно могу сказать о пляже и море. Невзирая на мелочи в виде  поломанного понтона, море шикарное. Пляж находится в небольшой бухте, благодаря этому красный флаг почти не поднимали, купайся сколько угодно. Глубина небольшая, рыбок много,  от понтона протянуты веревки - очень удобно. Ехать туда можно только ради моря. На пляже обслуживание тоже отвратительное, перекусы выглядят противно - кусок теста, на нем клякса томатной пасты, и 3 соломинки картошки. Пиво теплое, то нема, то нету. Публика в отеле соотвествующая - чисто СНГ, немного арабов. Я очень общительный человек, но тут ни с кем не хотелось даже разговаривать - кроме семьи беларусов и грузин. Мой вывод: лучше не экономить настолько. Еще 100 баксов к путевке - и отдыхаешь, как человек. А анимация хорошая! Единственное, что было смешно и мило.…"
Le Royale,2.5,,,,This is the third year I have visited this hotel. This year I was incredibly disappointed that standards had dropped so much. The room although large and reasonably well appointed was not cleaned properly. I was also regularly not supplied with water in the room which I had to collect myself from reception. The grounds had a strange 'sewer' odor at certain times of the day. Food was bland and much the same each day. Tables and chairs in the restaurants were not cleaned properly and were simply dirty. I witnessed one child throwing up on the food court floor. This was wiped with a mop using no water or disinfectant. The mop was taken straight back into the kitchen. Service was thin on the ground and inadequate. Having returned three times it's disappointing to say I will never return to this hotel. Wifi didnt work properly.…

Also I would mention the reception staff - so patient and everything organized.  The big minus of the hotel concierge service - which give bad impression about the hotel; staff around the hotel, who doesn’t give service, don’t know any English word. No any information about bus, how to move around the hotel as the territory is too big.  Also paper cups, even at the main restaurant. Rooms a dated.

I would like to stress that the pool attendant was very observant checking visually and verbally if everyone entering the deep pool could swim. He also  was certificated for life saving. All staff were very friendly and efficient even though they were under staffed. I would definitely stay there again The Hotel is situated in hadaba close to the AAIB Bank, shopping centre and a 30 min. Walk to the old market and restaurants. Some local Egyptian restaurants can be found in the back streets in hadaba .not posh but good tasty food at a very good price…"

Behind the desk sat a disinterested man not polite enough to shake our hands.  I noticed several piles of dirty laundry.  When we were taken to our apartment  I noticed a pool with no water surrounded by unkempt gardens.  We were then taken up a rickety old wood stair to the apartment which contained a very old and dirty sofa. The fridge was in the living area and the door handle was untouchable due to the dirty marks and dried on food. The inside had not been cleaned.Next the kitchen...an apartment for 2 had 1 glass,  2 chipped dinner size plates, a greasy frying pan and a pot used for deep frying which was covered in grease on the outside.  The cooker was a dirty greasy 2 ring job with deep scorch marks on either side on the formica,A microwave onto which was burned on food and filthy.  Next the bathroom, No towels or toilet rolls that were included in 'equipment supplied' The shower tray was engrained with dirt and had no curtain. The bedroom...dirty pillows, an unironed sheet and a top cover which was torn in many places.  No hangers...just dust in the wardrobes. Th e balcony contained a square, scratched and stained wood table, 1 wicker chair and an upright (dining table type chair).All in all a filthy disgusting place which I would not put a rat in...although there was probably a family living there. We returned to the 'reception' and demanded a refund of the 1200LE we had paid for 3 night.  We were told a 'nice"" apartment available at 9 pm if we stayed in the original one until then.  We couldn't wait to get out of the place quick a enough…"

It has to be the worst hotel we have ever stayed in to date.   We checked in and was gave a room that was supposedly the best room. The room looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years,  the room was filled with dust, the curtains where dirty and half hanging off, the bed sheets where old, dirty and had little bubbles all over like it had been used over a million times. There was rubbish left on our bathroom floor which included bits of fruit?? The shower head had mould and the shower was extremely dirty.  The hotel is placed on top of steep hill. The man made stairs will take you straight down to naama bay but be careful as if you miss a step, you will drop and severely injure yourself or possible death. At night there are no lights on the stairs so it's extremely hard to climb the stairs in the dark as it's stairs that are made up of mud.  The pool was GREEN, not blue and it looked like he hadn't been cleaned for months.  The only night we stayed, our room neighbours partied all night in front of the pool until around 6am. There was screaming, shouting and loud music for the whole night. If we opened our curtains, the people outside could directly see into our room.   We had booked at 7 night stay but after the first night we wanted to check out. The hotel caused a fuss when we did want to check out as we told them the problem with the room - they told us we wasn't allowed to check out and we need to contact our holiday rep. Our holiday rep did not leave any contact details so we couldn't contact him. The hotel had no details of the holiday rep either so they insisted we needed to stay. They tried to force us to stay but we didn't want too.   The room has no wifi connection so the next morning we went to the Starbucks in naama bay and jumped onto booking.com and booked at a hotel we have previously stayed at - Falcon Naama Star Hotel.   Upon leaving the hotel, the service desk refused to check us out again suggesting that it was necessary to stay. We told them that they cannot force us to stay and we are leaving and they can't stop us. We took our bags to the stair case where they had security. Yet AGAIN the security guards tried to stop us from leaving saying we are not allowed to check out until our holiday was over. We told them if they don't let us go we will have to report them.   Please do not stay at this hotel, we was made to feel like we wasn't allowed to leave with the hotel forcing us to stay.   Save yourself the hassle and book else where. We did not once regret leaving this hotel.  …"

The chef handling the buffet is very unprofessional and impolite. He served very little portion of food and did not want people to add more to their plates even though it was an open buffet. This is the last place i would stay at when i come again.   هذا هو حرفيا أسوأ مكان للإقامة على الإطلاق. لن أوصي به لأي شخص. المكان قذر جدا، الغرف صغيرة جدا وغير نظيفة ووجدنا الحشرات في كل مكان. موظفو المطبخ وقحون جدا والطعام فظيع لقد مرضنا. الشيف الذي يتعامل مع البوفيه غير مهني وغير مهذب للغاية. كان يقدم جزءا صغيرا جدا من الطعام ولم يرغب في أن يضيف الناس المزيد إلى أطباقهم على الرغم من أنه كان بوفيه مفتوحا. هذا هو آخر مكان سأقيم فيه عندما آتي مرة أخرى…"
