Breakfast: the buffet breakfast has a variety of options (sweets, different types of bread, vegetables, eggs, meat, omelette and crepes made at the moment, coffee and juices). The breakfast time is from 7 to 10 am and at 10 am they start already removing food and coffee machine, they were not very flexible although people were still eating.   Rooms: in our first stay we originally had reservation for a bungalow but when we arrived it was ""upgraded"" to a normal room with pool/sea view. The room was clean, with bottled water and clean towels. The safe in the closet was broken, but in the end there is no need to use it. Although it is stated that WiFi is not available in the room, we could reach it from the balcony or downstairs in the hall.  In our second stay we had a room with city view. We arrived in the weekend and there were more people compared to the first stay. So it was a bit noisy until 1 am.  The fridge and airco can also be quite noisy. In the morning the fire alarm rang (by mistake) and the staff started the room service before the check out time so they knocked our door while we were still sleeping.   Position: zya is in Sigala, on the main street full of restaurants and bazaars. From the hotel you can easily reach the marina (around 10 min walking). Hurghada old town is about 5 km (so we took a taxi).   Beach: we enjoyed our time at the beach,  we also rented masks for snorkeling (5 euro for 2 masks in total). Drawback:  The music at the beach at 11 am was very loud and we had to ask multiple times to switch it off.   Overall we paid around 22 euro per person per night so we believe that it is a very good deal considering that a 5-star hotel is much more expensive. ZYA is clean and quite comfortable so it is a good deal if you are willing to accept that it is not a fancy hotel.…"
