Mohammed’s mother cleans the room every day and cooks up the most delicious Egyptian breakfasts. Sam, Mohammeds brother, is a delightful host too and always quick to hand out bottled water.  And as for the view from the terrace…breathtaking! You have a clear unobstructed view of the great pyramids which is literally minutes away. I could never tire of this view and actually felt very emotional when I caught my first glimpse. Every day Mohammed checks in with you to make sure you are having the best possible experience. He is funny, friendly and we all got along famously. Mohammed has a fiend and driver called Deesha who we used nearly every day. His English, like Mohammed’s, is very good and he also has a great sense of humour - he’s also a safe and excellent driver which is essential in Egypt!  I have always wanted to see the pyramids so as a birthday treat, my husband obliged. On the night in question, Mohammed, Sam and his mother presented me with the most delicious birthday cake which he later shared with all the other guests. This is so typical of this lovely family. As seasoned travellers this holiday is one that stands out the most. The rich ancient history, the views, museums and mosque (Mohammed Ali Pasha) visit to the fabulous Khan el-Kalili market, the list goes on.

There was a tv table and a couple of chairs. Bathroom had a hot water heater. But our mini fridge is stocked with water and chocolate bars consumable at a minimum charge. So for me it was complete with everything I needed. You wouldn’t think that this place is just minutes away from the Giza pyramids. Either by horse or car it’s right there practically. Yes it’s so tranquil, away from city noise especially with the horses. They’re so serene and calming. So it’s the perfect place if u want something quiet and secluded almost felt like a retreat house yet very close to the desert and pyramids.   Staff is most attentive starting with Ali who always let me know that I can call him anytime. He’s there 24/7 unless he’s out on an errand. Sharif was very helpful with my sunrise ride in Giza desert and in teaching me some Arabic. Owners are very personable and hospitable. They serve a delicious Turkish coffee at a minimum charge. Ahmed their stable boy has a beautiful smile. I luv what I call the community room. People gathered there to talk or watch tv including the owners. When I stayed there, a couple of other female guests and I would meet  either here or right beside it where they had a couple of outdoor wooden couches by the corral.   Note that internet is weak, towels are smaller and breakfast is very simple but at least they are provided. Some places in Giza charge for towels (eg Draz etc). You have a choice between a room with a private shower and toilet or use the shared facilities. Be sure to turn on the heater before u shower or water will be a tad cold.   Luved the rooftop terrace. It is spacious. There is a beautiful view from there both at day and night. You can eat there, just enjoy the view out pray whatever u want. Waking up with horses onsite was a welcome experience for me. I’d luv to stay here again if I had the opportunity to return to Cairo. Thank u pyramids empire inn!…",Giza
Golden Pyramids Inn,4.0,"EGP 1,116","Bottled water,Safe,Sun terrace,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi),Free private parking nearby,","7 Abu Elhol Syahi St., Giza 12557 Egypt","This is a budget b&b hotel and you should not expect, whistles, bells, etc. There are many stairs and no lift. It is super situated for not only a great view of the pyramids from the roof terrace, access to the Sphynx and pyramids is almost across the road. WiFi - can be iffy. The staff are helpful and friendly. This hotel would have had a higher star rating, based on above, but one feature ruined the stay and star rating! I don't know how many rooms have interconnecting doors, but ours did. Room 101 has a locked inter-connecting door with room 102. You can hear everything in room 102 that goes on, including zipping of suitcases, very loudly and clearly.  Obviously this works both ways. Whilst the hotel cannot in any way be responsible for selfish, unthinking, self opinionated a*****s that book a room; they are responsible for the interconnecting doors. These doors should be replaced with a proper sound insulated wall. Having d****s knocking on doors, talking loudly both in their room and in corridors, laughing, unzipping suitcases, and anything else they do in the early hours can be clearly heard through interconnecting doors. We had a very poor experience in this department and had disturbed sleep every night. This has damaged the star rating.…",Giza

Sunshine Pyramids View,4.0,"EGP 1,168","Housekeeping,Children Activities (Kid / Family Friendly),Restaurant,","Nazlet El Semman Gamal Abd El Nasr St Al Haram, Giza 12511 Egypt","Sunshine Pyramids View hotel has the most spectacular view of the pyramids you could ask for! The manager of the hotel, Mohammed El-Komaty, is a super manager and very handsome young man. The hotel is very very clean, well appointed, and very private. You can’t beat the price and it includes breakfast! I would much rather stay here for $20 a night instead of five star hotels which run around $200 plus a night!    I have lived in Egypt for seven years now, but I always come from Luxor where I live, and stay here just to be with my old friends because I used to live here 10 years. The people here are like family. When I came this time, they had fresh fruit and  candy bars because they know I love chocolate, as well as my own private tea and coffee maker for the room. I am a writer so it’s important for me to have a quiet place in which to dream.  Right outside my door is a small patio where I sit, with table and chairs, surrounded by lovely little plants and wonderful little birds who live in the air conditioning unit above me. They sing every morning.  I love them. They are used to me now. I feed them bread and give them water.   Upstairs is a spectacular porch overlooking the three pyramids and great sphinx. This is where you go to have your breakfast or you can have your dinner up there. You can watch the sound and light show and admire the beauty in front of you.  The beautiful thing is, you walk downstairs and out your door and you were right by the Great Sphinx. No need to take a taxi! You can go in from that direction and walk all around the Giza plateau. Also, there is a lovely little market where I buy all my supplies for staying here for up to a month.. Around the corner is a lovely fruit stand where you can buy fresh fruit daily. There is also a pharmacy and numerous gift shops.   This time, I stayed for two weeks and it cost me the same amount as one night at a five star hotel! What is lovely is if you call Mohammed for something he will bring it. I needed a charger. He brought one for me to borrow until I go back home. All of that in five seconds too. If you need a car to the airport or need a car driver he’s on it. He also had a driver waiting for me when I arrived at the airport with a sign from the hotel. That was a wonderful service!  One of the things I love about this little hotel as it is out of the way. It’s very very quiet. The only thing is, you have to climb a few stairs, ( he’s hoping to get an elevator put in soon. )!However, I look at it is a form of exercise! I am 75 years old!  I just take my time going up the stairs!  Also, there are no stupid security checks like at the hotel, where you have to wait to be checked every time you go in. And best of all, you really do get to meet the people of Egypt. You find them to be the warmest and most beautiful people! You make lifelong friends here in the Village.  There are stables downstairs as well as carriages within walking distance. You can rent a horse or a carriage and see the whole place. I saved so much money on hotel and taxis I could afford to rent a private driver for a week!  So, when you visit Sunshine Pyramids Hotel, tell Hotel, tell them that KHADIJA❤️🙏 sent you!…",Giza

I have no idea how the price compares to similar hotels nearby because we stayed there with a gadventures tour.   Staff was amazing! All of them were great.   Rooms were basic. Our bathroom door didn’t close so that is probably a problem if you don’t want your roommate watching you shower or poop. Towels were hand towels so we had to use the camping towel we brought with us. It has a tv but we couldn’t get it to work but that may have been our fault. Beds were firm but that was fine for us so we slept well.   They did have a restaurant/bar (with alcohol) in the hotel so that was convenient. It was WAY too smoky for us so we just ordered food and drinks for our room.   The breakfast area on the top floor has a view of the Nile so it was nice to eat up there.   Before coming, I looked online to see which amenities were available but when we arrived, we didn’t find many of them:  WiFi: they technically said they have Wi-Fi, but none of us could get it to work. We even went to buy SIM cards thinking that was the problem but that didn’t help at all. As soon as we would leave the hotel, our phones would start working again so I’m not sure why nothing would work there. We even turned off Wi-Fi to try to use data and it still wouldn’t work.   Minibar: there wasn’t a minibar. They had a small refrigerator but it didn’t get cold so it was useless.   Pool: we were told there wasn’t a pool when we got there, but it mentions one on Trip Advisors. Not sure why it says that.   I went back and forth trying to decide between 2 or 3 stars. But Several people in our group had numerous problems with their rooms and the lack amenities that were advertised made me give 2 stars.…",Giza

Bed and Pillow covers have stains on! when we entered the room it was smelly from the toilet because the toilet was dirty and I asked the guy to come and clean it! the room is soooo old and there is no actual walls! there are partitions! so during the night we couldn’t sleep because there were traffic of people, talking loud and slamming doors! and the light comes out between walls and the ceiling! we slept only 1 hr whole night and the next day we checked out! there is no breakfast if there is no one making it for you! we waited 2hrs ! no breakfast!!! the room is even dangerous, the wires are out of the wall hanging here and there and the toilet door is almost hanging out! about the payment, the owner makes you pay cash for a part of the payment to skip the tax of the bank! so when we wanted to checkout the next day to go to another hotel he didn’t allow us and he didn’t give us the rest of the money back! very unprofessional!!!

City Pyramids Inn,1.0,,,"9Kaab Ben Malek, Giza 12557 Egypt","1. We never got the same room that was advertised on booking.com 2. Upon our arrival we were greeted by friendly staff with big smiles. We went to the rooftop terrace with Faru to discuss a camel riding pyramid viewing PRIVATE experience. Faru told us promises of amazing photography of the Giza Pyramids in the morning and incredible camel riding experience ect ect. We eventually agreed on a price of $230 USD for both myself and my wife for this tour. The next day we did the tour with our guide named Mohammed who took us on a very rushed tour NOT PRIVATE skipping over 50 percent of Giza (the part we were most interested in) and at the end I asked what about the camel tour? He replied that he didn’t know anything about camels being involved in this 4 person tour… After we arrived back to the hotel to speak to the manager Mohammed. At first Mohammed tried to blame us that we didn’t do the camel tour and after a couple more excuses ect ect he refunded us 80 USD of the money we paid and he pocketed the rest. Unfortunately this is Egypt and we took the small portion refund and learned a lesson. In the end Mohammed the hotel manager, Faru and the guide Mohammed scammed us by giving us the “basic” pyramid tour package valued at approximately $55 USD for 2 people in a group tour and they pocketed the rest of the money. The next day we did the Giza Pyramids again… solo NO TOUR and had an experience of a lifetime!…",Giza
