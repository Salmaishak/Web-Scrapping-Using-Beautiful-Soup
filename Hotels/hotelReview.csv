The pane vino restaurant was delicious and our waiter Adel rahman was helpful, friendly and very efficient.  We found the price is very reasonable and the view was great. This is a must place to eat if you‚Äôre in this area"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Hotel location is good. Walking distance to a couple of tourist spots in downtown Cairo. Breakfast is nice. House keeping guy Taha on 15th floor is very nice and helpful. Good place for long stay. Safe and comfortable.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"GATE 1 arranged this luxurious hotel for our Cairo stay ! It was an amazing experience, very friendly, hospitable , comfortable, efficient! The breakfast was fantastic ; views from rooms of either the Nile or Tahrir square were simply magnificent!  The luggages , check ins, check outs of ALL 57 of us were handled seemlessly by GATE 1 ! The buses were new, with WIFI and charge ports in every seat ! The drivers were  friendly and professional too ..,  THREE CHEERS to GUDES RIHAM, NEHAL and our driver ZACHARIYA! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº  The restaurants were fabulous too , especially the Indian  and Thai ones !"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Great Hotel with Solid Service. Especially the receptionist Yasser helped me and my mom book a reservation at the Revolving Restaurant & we had an amazing date and ambience over there which we really enjoyed.   Highly recommend and especially letting our dear friend Yasser do all the bookings, tours and reservations for you !"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"‚Ä¶.. that there was a time, before retirement, when the Intercon group was my very favourite and I enjoyed their highest status of Royal Ambassador ‚Ä¶ but these days I travel using my own money but still choose this brand when I am able to. The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!  Final Question? ‚Ä¶.. why is the same sandwich served three different ways in three days ‚Ä¶ the F&B director needs to question why standards are not being followed‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed , I and my wife, in Semiramis intercontinental Cairo, for 16 nights from 19/10/2022 to 4/11/2022. It was , as always, a wonderful experience . The reception was very courteous , we were upgraded to a stunning suite, the ladies in the executive lounge looked after us very well. The food was of wonderful variety..this is my 11th year of staying in Semiramis , will never stay anywhere else, in fact we , already, booked our trip for next year. I would like to thank Karim Zereef who helped us enormously, thanks to Mena  in the front desk, the ladies in the lounge, Mena, Hidi, Reem, Nermin . Thanks to Amanny, Waleed, Mehmood, Muhammed, Abu Zaid and the rest. Thanks , once again, to all of you who made our stay so nice and pleasurable‚Ä¶ See you, all, next year!!

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"My wife and I stayed here two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Very good location and attentive staff.  Our room was large, bed very comfortable and we enjoyed sitting on little deck over looking the Nile and the city.  The dinner and breakfast buffet was extensive, food well prepared and there was room for people to move around without banging into each other.  All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The worst reception and service I have ever had in a so-called 5-star hotel. No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I‚Äôve been to over thirty  intercontinentales, and as a royal ambassador I can say this was one of the top one or two. The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.   The ambassador club is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen, out of all the intercontinentales I‚Äôve visited. Only the one in Seoul is of the same caliber.   The location is perfect, right on the Nile and next door to the museum."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Booking and staff are very good and friendly.  THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel was very nice and all stuff qre very nice and friendly all are attentive and and decent, the room was very clean and well organized for me it is my second stay and the place is very safe i lost a phobe and they kept it with thek so thanks for all and for everything "

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed for 3 nights here in early November. The hotel was 5 star all the way. The morning breakfast was a spread that can't be matched. So many choices. The room was a good size and was very comfortable. The bed was the perfect firmness. There was a choice of different pillow types. The shower had plenty of hot water and good amenities. It had a rainshower head which we prefer. Our room steward/housekeeper was the same every day. His name was Mohamed Abdelslam and he was awesome! We frequently saw him during the day or evening and he always had a smile, asked us how we were enjoying our stay and if there was anything at all he could get us or do for us. It was a welcome home each day we saw him there. The front desk and concierge were always helpful with directions and answering questions. The location was great for getting around and we always felt safe.. We would highly recommend a stay here and would happily stay here again.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,It is my first visit to the hotel. I like it so mach in general.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Kempinski has been my home for a year since I have moved to Cairo for work and I have nothing but great things to say about this exceptional place. What makes it exceptional is their staff, from the reception guys which I will not say all their names but Mohaz, Mohamed are amazing, to their butler service, to Hassan making you feel most welcome to this hotel, to the cleaners And the guys that take care of your comfort. The hotel is small compared to some of the other chains here I. The Nile but, is quiet, clean, well located, and is price friendly compared to the others. The staff at this hotel go out of their way to accommodate our every need ( change rooms, better towels, directions, etc etc) they are impeccable. The amenities at the hotel are simple but on point, the view at the pool amazing, the spa 5 stars, the gym small and practical. I could write forever since I have had the chance to test every aspect of the hotel by living here for a year. On the food side, breakfast is amazing, Mariam greats you and Omar , Hossam and Mina and all others I might not memorize every name make you feel special. Blue is a good tasty Italian place and Osmanly is the best Turkey food you can ask for. Chocolate bar and lounge always good music and amazing deserts ( try the orientam plate)  I have to say thank you for making me feel at home away from home.  Ivan‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We were on a tour of Egypt and stayed at the Kempinski twice--once at the beginning and once at the end.  Both times, we were impressed with the service, the quality of food at breakfast and room service, and the freshly ironed bed linens.  Unfortunately at the end of our trip, we were quarantined for 5 days due to a positive test for Covid.  The staff provided us with everything from food to linens at our request in a timely and polite manner, which helped alleviate the boredom.  The concierge was outstanding.  She was able to find us a doctor to evaluate our ability to travel after 5 days, when no one else could--not our tour company or the American Embassy.  When we left, there were two pre-packaged breakfasts for us to take on our flight.    We definitely would recommend this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"A big thank you for Hady (your French is perfect) and Amir on the reception, guys you are amazing!!

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Hotel was great, a little tired round the edges but the staff were hugely attentive and professional. Thanks to Mina Girgis for all his help.  The breakfast spread is outstanding, boots were well and truly filled for the day. Location was good for us and despite taking life into our hands somewhat crossing roads, we could walk at night to various restaurants .  One thing, the breakfast manager asked if our servant was doing a good job. Might be worth the Kempinski addressing how they title their staff, having a ‚Äòservant‚Äô didn‚Äôt sit well with us. Our waiter was excellent and polite."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to attend a wedding.  The decor of the hotel is really nice; however, most importantly, the rooms were really dirty. We had a chalet by the pool. The floor of the chalet was dirty, as if you were walking outside. The toilet was terrible, filled with dust and mold.   Housekeeping service is terrible; they didn‚Äôt vacuum the floor; they just made the bed without changing the sheets; and they only provided new towels.   I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel, and I am not coming back."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I have no idea how this hotel got the 5 start designation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶not sure where to start but I will do my best to describe the experience as clear as possible. First of all, this hotel is one of the biggest wedding destination in Cairo which is perfectly alright except that weddings last till 4:30-5am and the music is so loud which means you will only be able to go to sleep then and not before.  Im by no means a litte sleeper. Second, the entire hotel smells like cigarette smoke including my room.  It is an awful smell for a non smoking person. Third, the room feels like it is dirty with carpet stain all over. Fourth, I had no hot water in my First day and when the plumber showed up, he ended up complaining about the unique system in this hotel which is every room has its own water heater‚Ä¶..I had to take a cold shower that day. Fifth, upon check out I called the front office to send over a bell man to help with luggage, that took 45 minutes (literally) I ended up brining down my own luggage so I do not miss my hired ride to the airport. I wish I read a review like this one before I made my plans but oh well, travel and learn‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Excellent place ! The room was clean and quiet. Excelent service .

Gymn is well equipped 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is actually quite lavish from the inside and has a lovely large garden, so ideal for an evening walk in winter. Lovely cafe, small cinema and nice restaurants. The rooms are ok, very standard. Amenities in the room are worn out. The SPA is below average and not enticing at all. The gym is working out and some treadmills don‚Äôt work. On check out they tried to pull a fast one, telling me that I consumed something from the mini bar and I know I didn‚Äôt. They even wanted to show me the wrapper from the garbage. A failed stunt to get money. So watch out."

This was the best thing we ever did.  Ahmed was so professional and helped us speed through the process,  He loaded the private transport car and our driver explained all of the sites to us along the way to the Hotel.  We were greeted immediately upon arrival and check in was a breeze and super fast.  Our room was upgraded for our joint Birthdays and Anniversary and we had rose petals around the room and a big heart on the bed with rose petals.  The most delicious sweets along with a strawberry shortcake was waiting for us in the room.  The hotel is so beautiful and our room has a view of the city and the Nile river.    We could not be more pleased.  What a great experience overall!"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1150283-Reviews-Staybridge_Suites_Cairo_Citystars_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"first of all I would like to mention Mr Amir, the director of this hotel, because he is one of the nicest persons I ever met, he tries his best to help and make you feel welcome. All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

Super super helpful staff even with my language limited to English only. I never made it to breakfast but it was nice to just pop over to the mall via the parking garage when I needed to. Bathroom a little small but there is the kitchen etc so that explains why. Overall good stay.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302323-Reviews-Sonesta_Hotel_Tower_Casino_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Reception and Senior staff  Our group of eleven arrived at the hotel after a late evening flight from Aswan for our three day-stay in Cairo.    The hotel was pre-booked by the Tour Company, but the reception staff were not ready to receive us, and we had to wait for over forty minutes until the rooms were allocated. Then we found that the rooms were not allocated as specifically requested. For example,  two single female guests were given a room with a double bed and a couple were given a room with twin beds! This gave the impression that the Reception staff either did not read the information supplied in advance or if they read them, they did not pay due attention to them.   The Reception staff did not appear to have much hospitality experience. The senior staff were rude, unhelpful, and unfriendly both on the telephone and during face-to-face meetings.    Portage The bell boys or porters were not very helpful, and the guests had to carry their own luggage to the rooms. This was significant given that the group members were senior citizens. This was the first time we had experienced poor service in a ‚Äú5-star‚Äù hotel.   Room Service Room service was prompt, house-keeping staff were very helpful and friendly.    Wi-fi Wi-fi connections and signal were excellent in the rooms and elsewhere in the hotel.   Rooms and bathrooms Rooms were spacious and quiet. However, they were outdated with many defects and shortcomings.   Some of the bathrooms did not have hand towels; some had no bath towels. Although there were tea/coffee making facilities, often there were no cups, teaspoons, tea, or coffee. The air conditioning was switched off and had a very unpleasant smell. In one bathroom, the electric wire in the hairdryer was wrapped in sticking plaster! Bathrooms had mould around the walls and round the bath. The tiles were broken or cracked. A common complaint by all the group members was that the bath handles were coming apart,  and dangerous to hold on to getting in and out of the bath. Door handles were loose and could not be closed securely. Some lights bulbs were not working, and some could not be switched off. These had to be turned off at the socket. Some rooms had not been serviced at all. This gave the impression that the supervisors and the managers had not inspected the rooms.    Restaurant and Meals  The Restaurant area was very small for a hotel with several hundred rooms. There was hardly any room to walk between tables once the diners were seated. Breakfast and dinner menus were basic and not much variety. If you went for a late sitting, food ran short. The Senior Restaurant Manager on duty for one evening was extremely rude and shouted at a guest. We had to report this incident to the Director of the Tour Company to resolve the issues. The restaurant waiters worked very hard but due to a shortage of staff, the service was below expectations.   Cleanliness There were bags of leftover food outside the room in the corridor.   Reporting At the end of our stay, we complained to the Assistant Guest Relations Managers Nermine Wagih and Madonna and provided them with a video and pictures of the state of one of the bathrooms. It was interesting that none of the mangers chose to speak to us and apologised for the poor conditions and service.   Conclusions Based on the above findings, we rate this hotel as 2-star, not 5-star. The contrast was obvious when we compared our experience at other 5-star hotels we stayed in Egypt. The advertised rating of this hotel is very misleading. It is damaging to the Egyptian hospitality industry too.   We have reported the above facts to the Director of the Tour Company we used.   We have made the above observations in good faith with a view to galvanising the hotel management to remedy the shortcomings listed above so that their claim to be a 5-star hotel is well deserved.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302323-Reviews-Sonesta_Hotel_Tower_Casino_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This is our 4th time staying at the Sonesta and here are our observations from this visit.   Front desk assistant manager, Ahmed Sobhy, was super helpful again as he always goes above and beyond to make sure we are enjoying our stay.  The hotel itself is in a good location, rooms are fairly sound proofed and clean. Housekeeping (Mohsen) was super attentive (as always) and quickly replenish whatever they notice you consume the most.  We were always used to staying at Sonesta whenever we travel to Egypt. And I must admit that this time the restaurant didn‚Äôt feel the same without Rosaline (Rose) around. She was always the first to greet us by name and make sure we are enjoying our breakfast to the most. Hopefully, she will be back in the restaurant managing things again soon.   Another drawback is the fact that they allow guests to smoke in non-smoking rooms. So expect to always smell cigarettes during your stay. This will probably never change as this was our 4th time to stay in this hotel, and they don‚Äôt seem to have leveled up to the non smoking policies adopted outside Egypt.‚Ä¶"

He said that we would never be satisfied and to find a different hotel.   Our room when we arrived was in a very unfortunate state. There is black mold growing all around the bath and it has cracked away from the wall. We have not been provided with a bath mat or hand towel since our cleaning yesterday. The toilet roll holder is broken and we were not given more rolls. The electrical plug under the window is dirty and doesn‚Äôt work. Our mini fridge is in a disgusting state and looks to be covered in old rotten food stains.   We were moved to another room on the senator floor and I immediately noticed that room was also a mess. There was dried urine splash on the bathroom floor, green mold growing in the mini fridge and the coffee cups were dirty. It also seems they don‚Äôt vacuum the carpets in between guests.   We were taken to a third room which again had a dirty floor, dirty mini fridge and black mold around the sink. We accompanied the head of housekeeping and the manager to the third room and showed them the mess. The head of housekeeping told me I was mistaken and the marble floor in the bathroom just looked like that. However, when she wet a tissue and wiped the floor, the tissue came away dirty. She then shook the dirty tissue in my face and told me it wasn‚Äôt dirty.   The wifi is very unstable and disconnects constantly. I had to reconnect almost every time I unlock my phone.   The staff here have been quite rude when we have been eating in the restaurants. In the Italian restaurant, I was brought the wrong order and when I asked for it to be corrected, the manager said it was what I had ordered, implying it was my mistake. I specially pointed at the meal I wanted so I don‚Äôt know how this confusion occurred. The correct meal was brought but I was disappointed by the rushed quality of the food.   The next night, we ate in the sushi restaurant and the waiter huffed at my order. He was rude and inattentive. We had to go ask for multiple items. We were one of only two tables in the restaurant so he wasn‚Äôt busy.   We then had lunch in the cafe and after the waiter was rude about my order, he brought the wrong sandwich. The sandwich was taken to be fixed, brought back and again had incorrect ingredients. I had to take the sandwich up to the manager and go over the specifics of what was wrong with the food. It took 55 mins for my sandwich to arrive correctly.   We have had four meals in this hotel and we have had a problem every single time. We are quite unimpressed with the state of this hotel and we would recommend you do not stay here until they fix the attitude problem amongst the staff and clean the rooms better.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1229187-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Cairo_Heliopolis-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Let's start with the positive. The lobby is beautiful and the property is nicely decorated. Now for the less positive. Although nicely decorated the hallways upstairs are showing  wear with many poorly done patches in the carpets. Our first room. It seemed like there was a bit of cigarette smoke as we first walked in. We started to unpack and the further we went into the room the worse it got. My eyes and nose were burning after only a couple of minutes. We also noticed the refrigerator didn't work when we went to put our water in so it would be cold in the morning. I complained to the desk about the smoke smell and they offered to clean the room. At 10 o'clock at night and a tour at 6AM that was not an option. By the way, cleaning a smoke fouled room is not as simple as wiping things off and changing the linens. It takes a number of hours of an ozone generator running in the room to accomplish the smoke removal. They provided us with another room. It was smoke free, however our clothes and luggage reeked of smoke, the refrigerator in this room didn't work either and the TV got no signal. Our cloths and luggage still smelled after arriving home. The clothes needed to be washed anyway but I had to clean the luggage and run our ozone generator for a few hours to get rid of the smell. This was quite a disappointment for a Radisson and unlike any other we stay in around the world.‚Ä¶"

The room was modern and comfy and the cold AC was perfect for napping. We grabbed food from the bakery/deli as well as some room service and it was good. The pool area looked very inviting and we heard that their Chinese restaurant is very good though it was closed when we were there. Definitely recommend this if you need a break during a layover or if you don't have to keep going into the city.

The Le Meridien Cairo Airport stands out for several reasons.    It is, without question, the most convenient property for those in transit.  The hotel is easily reached via a bridge from terminal three (domestic flights) and, for those arriving internationally in terminal two, access is also a breeze.  Beyond convenience thought are the professional staff that make the property special.  Selma, the guest relations manager went above and beyond to make my stay a pleasant one as did Fady, the night and assistant manager, and Abdelaziz, the front desk supervisor.  All three individuals are assets to this hotel."

With that said my room was definitely worn and needed an updated / refresh.  While not horrible, for a Le Meridian it was not nearly as nice as the other I have stayed in.  The staff was helpful, the common areas nicely maintained and hotel restaurant options were great.  There was a wedding the day I was there so seems the locals like it enough to host a wedding there so not just people going to / from the airport.  There is a complimentary shuttle bus every 30 minutes to the airport which is actually helpful especially if you are not in Terminal 3.  While you can walk to the other terminals if you have a lot of luggage, etc, the shuttle bus is nice.‚Ä¶"

The airport is linked to the hotel via an overhead bridge. They serve breakfast at 4am and you have a generous spread of buffet. Coffee is included so you just need to order with waiters.  As for dinner, the spread is also pretty generous. The only problem I faced is limitations of meat selections because I do not eat beef. Water is only served at 1 glass per person. I am not sure whether the waiter was joking with us or not but he told us it is. We are traveling in a group so we just take from other table.  Swimming pool is good for soaking.   Always check your bills and also ask for the price before ordering. Due to communication problem, you might face some problem during payment."

And you should put down a deposit for various treats like restaurant or spa /massage. Egyptians seem to me incredibly afraid of being cheated ,  mistakes cost people‚Äôs jobs apparently. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve been lectured at front desk when I had repeatedly been asked to prepay .  Coming to Egypt  often this is nothing new but in this place a guest should not feel distrustful .

Dear Gentlemen or Madam I stayed at your hotel while on a tour with Aventura Tours at the end of October.The first 2 nights I stayed in room 1439. The room was filthy.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   1. The carpet was stained, had something ground into it in areas,¬† discolored and did not appear to have ever been shampooed.2. The phone was sticky to the touch.3.The bathroom had a pubic hair on the back of the toilet. The door heeded some soap and hot water applied to it. The beautiful stone walls did not appear to have ever been washed. I suggest steam cleaning. The second stay in room 2249 was better, but the rug was still very dirty and in need of cleaning. The last evening of my stay I required a wakeup call. I had asked for one but when I thought about it I was uncertain I had given the men at the front desk the correct room number. I went downstairs to ask them to check and they refused to do so. A gentleman from my party tried to help me make them understand that I needed a wakeup call and perhaps they would wake up the wrong person because I had given the wrong room number.I must have spent 15 minutes trying to get it straightened out. Never did.Lasty, the man guarding the breakfast buffet woud not let me go in to get breakfast. I googled the Grand Nile Tower before leaving on the tour. You had a 3. I believe that is generous. You have such great potential to truly be a five star hotel. I hope you make changes or just deep clean the rooms.I can not and would not ever recommend this hotelunti changes are made. ¬†If this is the quality of hotels Aventura books, I need to really investigate accommodations before booking with them again. ThankyouKaren Dedmon ‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308091-Reviews-Grand_Nile_Tower-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The rooms were spacious with a great view over the Nile (I was too low to able to see the pyramids), the standard was so-so, but you could easily tell that this has some age to it. I would not exactly describe this an luxury hotel, but I do think I might have a bit higher standards. The room also had one of my pet peeves, but I was aware of it: carpets on the floor. The room was also seemingly clean, but I could see a few spot on the carpets that in addition to some dorm bunnies. The A/C worked somehow, but it was difficult to adjust the temperature. The TV in the room didn't work, nor did the mini-bar/fridge in the room. The bathroom were also aged, and it was a bit of a hazard to get in and out of the bathtub/shower. The hair dryer worked nicely. I did have some issues the key cards several times, but it was all easily fixed in the reception.   I did not have any problems with the Wi-Fi, it was very easy to use, and I was a bit reassured when I arrived and saw how it was, as I don't really like an open-open Wi-Fi service. But a lot of my colleagues had more troubles with the Wi-Fi, which I found a bit confusing.   I also payed for breakfast included with the room, the breakfast area in the lobby (Fotana Restaurant) had a lovely view, although it was quite noisy due to the layout. There was a great variety of food and drinks, but it was a hassle to ask the waiter/waitress for plain water everytime. The staff quite quick to remove the plates, but in terms of making the table ready for the next guests were so-so. I also observed that the coffee/tea part were changed during my stay, from self-service on a counter, to the waiter walking a trolley around. I also had breakfast down in the food court as I believe the lobby-area was full at certain time. I have the same remarks for there.  I went around the hotel as I had some free time, it was very nice that the hotel offered two ATM (which was particularly lucky for me, as I could get one of them to work for me). Be aware to get money in cash, there's few places that have changes for bills, especially the restaurant, but at least you have the option to pay by card. I was pleased that there were A/Cs throughout the hotel, but I do question how they were operated, as certain days it was so cold that I was actually freezing in the hotel. The swimming pool area was nice with a great view. The terrace floor was also nice, but completely empty of furniture. I checked some of the gifts shops, which were nice and bought some things since it was so easy, but I do think that the person in charge was a bit too pushy with a bit of a communication problem. I did inquire about the airport transportation - which was quite expensive, so I used a third party service which worked nicely. But for the ease of it, I would consider using the hotel's airport transportation if I traveled here again for the convenience.  During our stay I tried two of the restaurant located in the hotel: The Revolving Restaurant and the El Sakya Souk Restaurant with a group of colleagues. We were most satisfied with the Revolving Restaurant in terms of the food, but the services was better in the El Sakya Souk Restaurant. But the view at the Revolving Restaurant is gorgeous, just a shame that about the air pollution, as I believe it could have been even better without the air pollution. I would not recommend trying the pizza at the El Sakya Souk Restaurant. It is also prudent to remember the 12% service charge + taxes, and there's no alcohol, only non-alcoholic options.   It seemed that the hotel did a lot of things, I could observe at least two weddings during my stay, a lot of tourist groups; and there was some loud music happening in the evenings. In additional to our own conference, the facilities for it was satisfying. There's also quite a lot of smokers in this hotel, especially in the lobby, which was a huge cultural shock as this isn't usual for me/us. Grand Nile Tower is a very busy hotel, lucky I could not hear or sense this in my room. The staff were very friendly and polite, but I do think that there were some communications problems/errors. ‚Ä¶"

Unfortunately loud music during the evening. Large and clean room with balcony. The room are a bit worn out. We got a room with a view to the Nile. Beautiful! We arrived late as a group. Despite several calls in advance no keys were prepared for us, so we had to wait a while.  Breakfast the first morning was in the food court. Many guests had to wait for clean cups. The waiter came only with 3 - 4 cups at a time. No cold milk for the cereals. Cutlery were in plastic. Breakfst the second morning were in the lobby and all went fine. When arriving for dinner the first evening our group were refused access to the restaurant. It showed to be a mistake from the hotel. There were only 2 waiters in the restaurant to clean the tables and receive orders for drinks. They did what they could but could not avoid the guests had to wait to be able to order their drinks. It was not possible to get the drinks on the room but we had to pay before leaving the restaurant every day. No alcohol on the hotel!‚Ä¶"

Otherwise it was nothing to write home about.   The room we had had a dead wasp. There was mold in the shower rack. The room we had was so far we had to go outside and into another building.   The check-in was awful too. We were early and even offered to pay extra for early check-in, but they didn‚Äôt allow it until 9am when we arrived at 6am. We were also had our luggage searched because it seems the guy doing the check can‚Äôt tell how a shaver power cord looks like.   The hotel lobby was filled with cigarette smoke too.   Check-out was also painful when we requested for a bellboy to help us transport our luggage. No one picked up the guest service line.   The meals downstairs were also bland and not really good. Although I can give them credit that I did not get sick, which was why I stuck to their buffet offerings instead of eating out and risk getting sick before a long 12 hour flight.   I‚Äôll never recommend this hotel even if you need to be close to the airport. Truly terrible all around experience here and in Egypt.‚Ä¶"

Good location, good rooms and excellent services including free shuttle bus services to Cairo airport terminals. Efficient reception and guest relations staff, perfect house keeping services makes the hotel environment Covid safe. "

Check-in wasn't great, as commented by other reviews. Worse was the room which smelt like an ashtray - if there were non-smoking rooms we were not asked if we would want these; the room was disgustingly filthy, especially the bath and shower curtain; there was a half eaten muffin on the desk in the bedroom. We only had a 4 hour stay but it was awful, the smoking smell was s strong that I couldn't sleep even though very tired.. Other travellers on my flight who had also been placed in this hotel said their rooms were equally bad (but they didn't have half eaten muffins) and they also didn't sleep.  If you are a non-smoker and are forced to go in this hotel by your airline, ask if they have non-smoker rooms.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Modern hotel near the airport with shuttle - a bit soulless but neat and clean - with nice pool and pretty decent restaurant.  Only issue - which is common in Egypt - is staff expecting you to have exact money. They try to collect city tax in cash but have no change available and get angsty when you have no change either. Novotel - you are the one running a business - how hard is it to keep a drawer of change on hand.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Hi . Check in experience was horrible right from shuttle at the airport to the front desk. . When at the hotel the front desk did not have the courtesy to look after my reservation and they were busy with Egypt airline cancellation bookings ‚Äì they were totally unorganized and ignorant looking after people who came after me. . The agent in front desk did not brief anything about our room had to get information from the   bell boy. That was pathetic and I was served as though its free accommodation given. . Did complained with the duty manager by the name Amir and he was apologetic on the    experience and he assured by on my check out he would have a breakfast box ready since we had to check out time at 4:00 am and I was not surprised even this was not obliged as well. Overall pathetic experience I would not recommend anyone to this property. ‚Ä¶
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Check out services teriible. Plenty of wasting time. Being close proximoty to airpprt very busy but staff at reception takes too much time. All the info is there in the system but they need to check inside etc. Very disappointed.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I picked this hotel for my one night stopover at Cairo before flying back. As it is right next to the airport with a free shuttle to and from the airport, it was a no-brainer. I also asked them to keep my luggage at the hotel for 3 days before my check-in and they had no issues. It was tagged and kept in the back storage room safe and sound. They also provided me a number to contact the driver when I land, but that number didn't work. Even the hotel number on their business card was not working (saying it is invalid), which was weird. However, after much fiddling I did get a hold of the driver and was able to catch the shuttle from the airport. The shuttle to the airport runs every half hour (at the top of the hour), if there are passengers present, so that wasn't a problem.  The front desk staff was a pain to deal with. Not that they were not friendly, or helpful, but they were slow. If you thought DMV was slow, guess again. Either they were overwhelmed or they were all trainees, but this is the most time I have every spent at a check-in our check-out at any of the hotels I stayed at. The lobby is very nice with a pool in the back, and the night we arrived they even had a live concert (Arabic) happening. Thankfully it finished around midnight else sleeping would've been an issue.  The passageways to the rooms are visibly dated. They felt more like a motel than a Novotel. However, the rooms were clean and all the amenities were there. Our night sleep was much more comfortable than I could've imagined. Also, our room door had a broken deadbolt, so that was something. Food service was sub-par. We ordered dinner around 9 and they gave us stale bread, maybe 2 days old. Even the meats were not fresh. I would advise eating ahead before coming here. Breakfast is a buffet spread and that was good. But we did not have it included so had to pay $10/person. Overall, a good hotel for a quick stopover before catching your flight, but do not plan to stay longer.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"->Area and Surroundings: The hotel is great in terms of location as it is next to the Nile River and connected by two bridges on the either side. One can walk for 5-10 minutes for reaching a general conveno store.   ->Room: I was upgraded to Nile facing room by hotel compliments. The walk to the room was very long, the carpets in the corridor made it difficult to drag the bags, the ceiling height of corridor and room was pretty low.   The room was a normal room, and I did not find it to be too big in room size. All the furniture in the room was decent. The design of the room was pretty old compared to the new modern hotel rooms which are able to take our more space in the same size of the room.  The view from the room was of NILE river and that was one of the consoling factors. At the time of our stay the hotel was undergoing paint work, hence we had to use sheer curtains / blackout curtains for privacy.  The service was very very slow. We asked for water and ice it took them 1 hour to get it, each time we called reception they use to say ‚Äúthe person is on the way‚Äù. They well knew that there were two guests in the room, then also only 01 water bottle was placed on each day instead of entitled two bottles. The reception gave a QR code to contact hotel for services on whtsapp, when I tried, there was no response on the same.  The pillows were extremely not comfortable, when asked to change for feather pillow, thin pillow or orthopedic pillow, the hotel simply denied.  ->Bathroom and Bathing experience: The bathroom was also decent. The setup for shower was like an arrangement which may fall apart at any moment.   ->Hotel Staff: The staff was not upto the mark. We requested the evening staff for preparing our meal boxes as we had a 3:20 AM departure to catch a light. They took our preferences and confirmed. Next day morning what was provided in the breakfast was totally different from what was confirmed.  ->Breakfast: The buffet breakfast was well managed and the spread was good. There were plenty of vegetarian options. The desert / pastry was a miss.  ->Swimming Pool / Gym / Spa: The hotel had a swimming pool like there are few at houses/ appartments. Simply basic  ->Lounge access: I did not have the lounge access.  ->Special mention: Wifi is free, and the speed is not very good. I would suggest a overhaul to the hotel for its floor or reduce charges of the room rate. Its not value for money.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is an absolute tip and the service from reception staff is appalling.  Stayed here on 2 occasions for 1 night at the start and end of my trip. First night the guy at reception insisted we hadn't paid although we had as it was a business trip. He was rude and kept shuffling the card machine towards me for payment, insisting we couldnt check in until parent was made. His attitude changed when he realised we had someone with us who spoke Arabic, then he was full of smiles and allowed us to check in stating parent had been received, he just couldn't allocate it.  They take scans of your passport and leave people's personal details in full view on the counter  for anyone to see or even take.  The room clearly hadn't been cleaned and I booked a double when I was given 2 singles with an unlocked adjoining door which made me feel on edge the whole night.   The second night I stayed there, I asked the man on reception if he could confirm payment was received on their system and he insisted it had and we could check in (great). The room this time was disgusting. Dirty carpets that hasn't been hoovered, the bathroom was falling apart with paint flaking all around the shower and just overall grim appearance. Two single beds again when a double room was booked and the Aircon was like a jet engine!  Got woken up on several occasions by housekeeping from 7am wanting to clean my room. Their urgency to clean my room was a shock given the general state of it.  Upon checking out my colleagues had no issues until it was my time to check out and again, they insisted I had not paid. I evidenced booking confirmation and they did not want to accept it and again kept pushing the card machine towards me. The staff were rude especially a female member of staff who had appalling attitude. This went on for nearly 30 minutes with the staff instsiting I hadn't paid, getting the general manager to talk to me and state I could not leave until I paid. This was extremely stressful given I had to leave for the airport. After 30 minutes of them being rude and calling me a liar, the general manager said I could go. When I asked if he'd located payment he stated no but I could go and he would chase up with my organisation for payment & this never happened.   Clearly a hotel with staff trying to con people out of more money. DO NOT STAY HERE.‚Ä¶"

The corner executive rooms has recently been renovated and were lovely and spacious, we had an extra bed for our son.  Room was lovely and clean.  We had breakfast most mornings in the executive lounge which was lovely and relaxed. We had breakfast once in the main restaurant and it was chaotic due to the number of groups in at the one time.  The pool area is nice and my son enjoyed the water.  Breezes bar is decent for a quick lunch / watch the World Cup etc.  room service was excellent and very good value.  Staff in the executive lounge were excellent and we liked the daily happy hour from 5.30-730 nice to do after bush days out and about.

Cold,  dry buns with some eggplant in them, bottle of juice and water in each bag. We could not eat the buns at all. Very disappointing. "

We checked in rather late and told the front desk of my status.  We were given room on the 11th floor. When we got there the room smelled with cigarette and the bathroom tiles had molds in them.  The faucets were constantly leaking, and there was not enough covering on the bathtub to keep the water from spilling on the floor when we took a shower.  My wife who is asthmatic, and has cancer, and myself did not get that much sleep. The following day, I complained to the front desk and was transferred to room on the 19th floor which was somewhat better as there was a shower curtain, although the faucet was also leaking.  The breakfast was good though and the Indian restaurant was great!  Other than these positive comments, honestly, this is our worst hotel stay ever.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d300669-Reviews-Ramses_Hilton-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"A heartfelt shoutout to Remonda Adly, Silvia Samir, and Mohamed Taha from the Executive Floors team: thank you again for the great experience, it was very much appreciated!  Location: If you're trying to stay downtown near the Egyptian Museum and Tahrir Square, this is very central. The Egyptian Museum is literally a 3 min walk, and the corniche walkway is right across the street.  Breakfast: Great selection of local and western options. Onsite chef can customize your omelets, as well as other fresh options. Coffee (americano, espresso, cappuccino, etc.) and tea selection is pretty good. They also had 2 onsite options of freshly squeezed orange juice and mango juice while I was there.  View: the Hilton is probably one of the tallest buildings in the vicinity and the top floors give you great sweeping views of downtown, parts of old Cairo, and the Nile. If you have lounge access, you'll have ready refreshments to go with the view, as well as some breakfast options. The room I stayed in was recently renovated, and had all the amenities you would expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel.  Service: this is where the hotel really shined for me. Taken I do have status with the hotel, but I couldn't have asked for anything more. From early check-in to late check-out, everything was very smooth and personable, and all the staff members I encountered were quite helpful. I was also given access to the lounge after my checkout until the next step of my itinerary. Ramses Hilton definitely knows how to take care of its tier members.  Other notes: The gym was a little bit on the smaller end, but had everything I needed. The elevators are a little outdated and could be a bit slow, especially if you're heading to the top floors, but personally I didn't mind: these are all small prices to pay for all the other benefits. Definitely a 5/5 in my book :)  I look forward to coming back soon.‚Ä¶"

Hilton Cairo Heli√≥polis surpassed all of these expectations.  As soon as we arrived, we realized that security is a detail that makes all the difference. All cars are inspected and the bags go through a metal detector and x-ray.  When we entered the hotel we understood why all security: surely only the highest authorities stay in this hotel. In fact, more than a hotel, the Hilton Cairo Heliopolis looks like a big conglomerate. During the three nights we were in Cairo, we didn't have to leave the hotel for dinner, because inside the hotel there are Arab, American, Italian, Japanese, Mexican restaurants... and much more...  The leisure area is sensational!! The pools are for all tastes, whether for children or adults. In addition, we realized that the hotel is keen to ensure that we are well taken care of at all times.  The breakfast was amazing, highlighted by chefs Ahmed and Mohamed who were very friendly preparing our fried eggs and omelets. We love the incredible experience provided by Hilton Cairo Heliopolis.  Finally, we are grateful to the helpful hotel concierge team who assisted us with everything we needed, from tours to local activities. On the last day we needed to take the COVID test and the concierge arranged for a doctor to come to our hotel room, making our routine a lot easier.  We recommend the hotel without a shadow of a doubt, you will be very well attended!  Philippe (@pspelomundo)‚Ä¶"

However we didn't hear any noise and slept well, because of noise deduction measurements taken at the windows and building.

An impressive hotel. It was huge & very busy with tourists. Our room was on the 5th floor.  The best thing about Hilton hotels is the format & amenities are the same, wherever you go in the world. Big bedroom, big bathroom. The bed was huge & so comfy. Without doubt it was the comfiest bed I‚Äôve slept in, in the last 12 months. It was like sleeping on a cloud. There was a welcome platter of fruit & pastries waiting for us. The hotel has many restaurants to visit. We are & drank in the English bar downstairs next to the casino & watched the World Cup football matches. Food there was very good. Breakfast in the morning was standard Hilton fare, but with some local dishes. Peacocks in the gardens too! A complimentary shuttle bus brought us to the airport. A delightful stay. Would highly recommend..‚Ä¶"

They helped to arrange a trip both from and to the airport, even for my flight that arrived at 2:00am. The location of the hostel in the city is excellent. Very convenient for all locations you may wish to visit. Located on the top floor, the open air rooftop layout of this hostel offers excellent views and wonderful communal spaces. Dahab hostel provides a wonderful breakfast every morning for a very affordable price; the perfect way to start your day. The bathroom facilities were very clean and the staff was very attentive. The bedrooms are small, but with all there is to see in the city, along with the shared spaces available, you'll only need your room for sleeping. I would recommend Dahab Hostel to all my friends looking to visit Cairo. ‚Ä¶"

Some people staying there for one month or longer because it is so lovely!  Now I can understand why.   The people are amazing there!   The best staffs ever.

Staff extremely helpful and assist you not only with hotel related stuff but also with trip advice, safety and assistance.  Salama was very helpful when assisting me with my train booking to Alexandria. He was also very kind when asking about my plans and giving me local knowledge of the different parts of Cairo. Ahmed checked me in on several occasions and always enquired as to how I was doing and gave me some sterling safety advice when taking public transport. The lady who made me breakfast every morning 'Ohmmaqmood' I think her name was, accommodated my nutrition requirements without question.   Overall if you are visiting as a solo traveller or a couple, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. The service is second to none! "

They have a complementary airport pick up and drop off (although I believe this is for guests with Bonvoy status).  Their service is punctual and efficient.   Overall, the hotel has great, clean accommodations and at least 4 restaurants. We used their heated pool and had a great time at the hotel lounge, where they have a variety of food and drinks.  Amir Salah Eldin and his staff at the lounge did a great job in ensuring that we were always made feel welcomed.    Thank you for your great service and hospitality! We have a great time in Cairo."

Was in Cairo for work and got to spend two weekends and evenings here in this wonderful hotel.  The hotel is very clean, the rooms are fantastic, and the staff is very helpful.  Used the concierge for several bookings with the hotel car and a day tour to the pyramids.  Everything went very smoothly and I didnt have to worry about a thing.  The executive lounge is excellent with delicious food and plenty of drinks in the evening.  the staff in the lounge is excellent and always met me by name with a smile.  I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention a specific staff member, Aya.  From the moment she checked me in until i checked out two week later she was a constant bright spot in my days.  She anticipated anything i might need and always checked to make sure that I had everything i needed.  She truly is one of, if not the best, Marriott employee i have ever encountered.  Always a smile and always thinking about how she could help me.  She is an asset to the JW Cairo for sure.  I cannot wait to come back and visit again as soon as I am able!‚Ä¶"

He is proving that customer service is a key and because of it, I asked all our team members to stay in the same hotel every time we visit Cairo for business meetings.

Had two superior rooms with sofa beds in each, with city views (quieter than Nile view?)  Reception staff were extremely helpful allocating both rooms on the same floor, close to each other, Floor 5. Rooms were a good size, very clean, beds very comfortable and the sofa bed adequate for two children aged 6 and 7. People have complained about the outside noise from Nile cruises into the night but this did not cause a big issue. We had read reviews so were well aware. Do your research before you stay! Housekeeping staff were very attentive to any needs or requirements for our room, always with a smile. The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of choice of both hot and cold food. Omelettes etc. were also made to order. The rooftop restaurant was a nice place to chill with great views over Cairo. The swimming pool was on the small side, very clean and a relaxing place to chill as a family. Used Ubers for getting around and walked to many places too. Plenty of Restaurants in the area and small supermarkets for drinks, snacks etc. All in all, a very welcoming, well equipped, spotless hotel with great staff.‚Ä¶"

Thanks for the staff starting with a talented guest relation also reception team and the helpful house keeping team.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1200790-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_El_Borg-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The noise in the room from the outside of the hotel makes it completely impossible to sleep. There is absolutely nothing the hotel can do about this . But if I knew about the noise I would I stay at another hotel . The music is so loud you can‚Äôt hear the TV   The hotel is ok . Basic and clean .  The rooftop bar does not serve alcohol .  We don‚Äôt eat or use the facilities.  Although well located I would not recommend this hotel based on the noise .
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1200790-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_El_Borg-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"If you intend to sleep, DO NOT stay at this hotel. For a 5 star hotel it was a terrible stay.  I stayed for 3 nights on both sides of the hotel. Either side you stay it was extremely loud and could not sleep. It sounded as if the there were no windows or the windows were open. ABSOLUTELY NO SOUNDPROOFING. Nile side had party boats and nightclub playing extremely loud music directly across from the hotel till 3am and the other side had the opera house which also played very loud music till late at night. I could hear absolutely everything from extremely loud music, constant beeping on the streets and call for prayer music. After reading the reviews from others it appears they always reply with customer care is a priority however all the rooms are renovated but the issue of soundproofing was completely discarded. Complete disregard for customer comfort. Also wifi within the hotel unusable. Don‚Äôt even bother with wifi. I don‚Äôt often write reviews but for this hotel I felt it is required so no one else experiences what I did. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME AT THIS HOTEL!!!!‚Ä¶"

Why spend the money to renovate and not address such a fundamental problem ?.  The nightclub and party boats that moor across the road play loud music until 03:00. Then at 4:00 there is the first call to prayer by they equally loud  and mega-sized speakers from the mosque next door.   Wifi terrible but this is Egypt so buy a local SIM.  As for the noise, even earplugs couldn‚Äôt fix the problem.  Stay somewhere else ( even the 3 star we previously stayed in which had better soundproofing)."

The hotel staff very kindly arranged a car from the airport to the hotel and a room was lovely. Breakfast in the morning is good and the concierge helped arrange dinners. The only problem that I would advise Travelers to stay away from is the Hacienda tours in the hotel lobby. They are, in my opinion, somewhat shady. Buyer definitely beware."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1200790-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_El_Borg-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Offered an upgrade to Nile facing suite and whilst appreciated I suspect the rooms on the Nike side are often vacated for quieter rooms on the other side of the hotel. Party boat music starts in the late afternoon and finishes after 2am. Loud irregular drumming and some amateur sounding singing does grate on the nerves. Turning the fan up full on your rooms AC does help to drown out the noise slightly but occasionally there was a live female singer whose voice could shatter the hotels windows. If you wear hearing aids or sleep with noise cancelling headphones then you‚Äôll be okay. The actual room and the view over the Nile was very nice so hopefully the Novotel has plans to add some social glazing in their windows for the party boat noise. Pool was small, some reception staff had difficulty with English and ambiance of hotel seemed more for Egyptian business people.   For cheap water and snacks: exit the hotel facing the Nile. Turn to your right and walk down the first street to your right ( you dont have to cross the road). A very honest man that does not export tourists owns a small minimart. Small water 4LE, Small Sprite 5LE, Small Dorito chips 6LE.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1200790-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_El_Borg-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Really a terrible shame.   What could be a very nice hotel,let down by complete neglect.  Internet completely unworkable.  You may be able to log on occasionally, but it is unusable.  They say you can go to the lobby and use and fob you off with stories about passing complaints to IT manager.  People are not going to Egypt to surf internet, but in todays connected world where everything is done online this is really too much.  Want to check your flight details? Bad luck, head to the lobby.  Want to talk with family and friends back home, bad luck.  Want to order an under eats or car to go to the airport, your outa luck.  Want to keep kids entertained with YouTube after a long day touring? You guessed it.   Room service food I found terrible, but kids liked it.  If you have taste of eight year old child then I guess this is good enough for you.  Rooms in bad need of refurbishment, but the beds are genuinely comfortable.  Staff are nice and friendly, trying to help where they can.  There is a fun fair and disco river boats stationed directly across from the hotel.  The noise is extremely loud.  Kids talked me into taking them down and we had a good time.  If you are thinking of sleeping anytime before late/early morning than think again.  Avoid at all costs using the tour service in the hotel lobby.  After confirming the tour with them and all costs involved they immediately started asking for extra money for entry fees, extra money for car entry, insisting that they pay for entry tickets etc etc.  They immediately stoped at a papyrus ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù for high pressure sales, and when at the pyramids then dump you with aggressive camel touts and insist that the tour you paid for is only a taxi fee to drive you back and forward from the hotel. Only the threat of getting police involved  as the camel tout was leaning in the car screaming at me and my 8 year old daughter who was shaking in fear when we refused to pay hundreds of dollars for additional add ons to the ‚Äútour‚Äù got them to leave.  In short do not have anything to do with this hotels tour services.  A complete disgrace and an embarrassment for the Novotel hotel range to be associated with.‚Ä¶"

The night manager went above and beyond to coordinate our transportation to the hotel and stayed engaged with us every step of the way. When we arrived, we were greeted with kindness and excellent customer service. The property was well maintained, the room was beautiful and everyone on staff made our visit very enjoyable. The property is far from Giza and other tourist areas. However, the St. Regis team will definitely make it worth your while. Would absolutely stay there again."

First I thought something happened to the hotel and they had to close it for an emergency. I went to the hotel website to make a new reservation for the same dates only to find out that they have lots of availability but the price is doubled. I have been traveling for 45 years with thousands of hotel experiences and never have I experienced anything like this.

The service and the food at their different restaurants are excellent and they go an  extra mile to make sure you're having a good time.  Their SPA offers a very professional and great service.   It's a little far from the main attractions in Cairo, but definitely it's a great place to stay and relax away from all the noise from the city. Again... Definitely recommended 100%  Their  entire staff from the reception at your arrival all the way to you departure  and everything in between. They will make sure you have all you need and that you are enjoying your stay.  I'm pretty sure will be back again and stay here in my next visit to Cairo.‚Ä¶"

The main spa was closed (Utopia), and most services we tried to access were not available.  Staff rude, service non-existent.  Took over two hours to get food at lunchtime, and 25 minutes to get a Diet Pepsi by the pool!  Management did not care. We left after two of a planned seven nights.  Absolutely not befitting a 5 star rating or the St. Regis brand."

A lovely young lady - Ms Sara Hussam El Din was the Member of staff taking my call, she was VERY friendly, pleasant, attentive to every detail I mentioned and was the reason why I actually booked our weekend! I had asked her for a special arrangement for my daughter and it was much better than what I had dreamt of. Sara was so professional that she managed to make me willingly stay at a hotel that is almost 1.5K more than my initial budget :) (and I type this with a huge smile on my face)   We arrived at the reception, staff were amazing and friendly, especially Menna and Maryan (I think) Menna knows who I‚Äôm talking about. Please refer to her.   We were guided to our STUNNING room. Then we went to the pool- a huge thank you to Hany at the pool who was very supportive, friendly and had a huge smile on his face- very welcoming and attentive as well. I want to thank Hany for being dedicated and focused, I forgot my expensive tanning oil and when we went to the pool the next day he had kept it for me in lost and found which I really appreciated.   I also want to thank Dyana at the pool bar, she does the best lemon mint smoothies, she‚Äôs always smiling and pleasant to talk to. She focuses on details mentioned and doesn‚Äôt forget what was requested. She‚Äôs very professional as well and is keen to be a great representative to the hotel.   Food Quality Review: - breakfast buffet: was good, diverse and clean.  - pool bar: drinks we ordered were lemon smoothies and chocolate milkshake, clean, fresh and refreshing, we ordered a pizza on the pool it was also good. Nothing fancy, just a usual pool side pizza which we enjoyed.  - room service (or private dining as they call it): they made us an amazing cake for my daughter, fruits are fresh and clean, bakery is amazing at this hotel, my daughter had a which sauce pasta with chicken which she enjoyed, I had ordered the cold m√©zza platter, it needs to be revisited and I had shared my feedback with Mr Alaa the head of the Room service department and he was keen to know my feedback for improvement which Im sure he would work on as he seems like a professional and experienced Manager.   Housekeeping; When we arrived the room was amazingly clean, spotless and was well decorated for my request. Thanks to the team. My only comment is that the following morning I had the sign on for the room to be cleaned from 7:00 am until 12:30 and when we came back to the room it wasn‚Äôt cleaned. I would highly request for the housekeeping team to keep a close eye on such small details as they‚Äôre doing an amazing  job keeping the entire hotel clean.   Overall rating is a 8.5 and I would definitely go back again for a vacation!‚Ä¶"

From the outside, the hotel looks new and luxurious, as well as in the common areas of the hotel. However, the rooms are small, the beds are uncomfortable, the windows do not close completely. The rooms need updating, you can see that they are old. There were 3 people in the room, we only got 2 sets of towels. The staff took our luggage to the room (not asked for it) and insistently demanded a tip for it. In general, the service is very imposing when it comes to luggage, even when you say that you can handle it yourself, they snatch it from your hands (of course they want a tip later). If you want to sleep, you won't be able to either. The hotel plays very loud music and there are live shows until 00:00. It's unacceptable for it to be loud for so long. In addition, at 04:00 someone was making a fuss in the next room and the phone to call the reception did not work. Breakfast decent but we never got the tea we asked for. This is one of our worst hotel experiences. The only plus is the free shuttle to the airport.‚Ä¶"

The 1st room we had the bath tub wall fell in and cause major flooding so we moved to a new room.  2nd room: Still very old and smelled like smoke. Must be from 1970s cigarettes. Coffee machine was broken, 1 light fixture wouldn't stay on and the fridge didn't turn on.  Room Service: Large menu back everything we ordered lacked any taste.

Loud music all night past midnight! üò°  There was a wedding party each night that took over the entire pool area. Not a relaxing experience at all. This hotel should create an in closed banquet/party space to cater to  weddings. This would allow other guests who actually paid to stay here to enjoy the amenities. Hotel has nice decor. Room was good size with comfortable bed. Refrigerator in room. Restaurants were ok but service was very slow. Breakfast was good with many options.

The penne ariabata was amazing from the Italian restaurant. The waiter was kind enough to make us a non alcoholic mohito. Tje chef at breakfast was very good too interactive and no request was ignored.   I was traveling with young children ranging from 2 - 8year old and 2 other adults. We had connecting family room with a cot bed. Room service always cleaned rooms. The bathroom could do with some renovating but overall it was OK. The balcony had a nice view facing the swimming pool. The swimming pool was warm however kids pool was cold! There was a play area for kids, which was constantly being cleaned and it was great fun entertainment. They had a big screen outside but not anything decent to watch. It would be nice if they had movies playing give it an outside cinema feel.  They did have weddings there in the outside area and the music was a little bit loud but to be honest we really enjoyed it. The music kept going until after midnight.   We booked most of our activities through the hotel and our driver Mohammed was amazing. He made us feel safe and made sure we had an excellent time. The hotel should be very proud to have him. The manger of the activities (didn't catch his name) was the complete opposite. He made inappropriate comments towards us which made us uncomfortable. The other thing that really was not nice was the constant bugging from porters asking us where we had been and how much we paid for the activities!!! We did bring this to the hotels attention in the end. I understand why they would ask in the reception and write the info down but the porters were riding up elevators with us to ask!!!! This should be prohibited as it becomes very awkward.   Overall stay could've been 10/10 easily if the few things could be improved. Great stay for families with young children.‚Ä¶"

When I did get changed the next evening, the private bathroom was actually across the hall, accessible by key and super inconvenient. The rooms themselves are huge, but have no personality or character, just all white walls, white bedding, bright overhead lights. Staff were friendly enough until they realised I didn't want to book any tours or private drivers with them, then they lost interest. It's a budget hotel, so I didn't expect the Ritz, but there are better out there.

The room had not really been cleaned the bath was grimy, there was wet dirty tissues next to the toilet, the sofa was stained but worst of all the bed had pieces of dirt &  hair in it. It was disgusting. Our flights were delayed so by this point it was 2am & we had to move rooms from 114 to 714. we complained and were given a new room, but At no point did anyone apologise or offer us compensation. On top of that the receptionist said we could have a free breakfast but then she made us pay for it because the manager wasn‚Äôt there. We asked to speak with the manager and waited for an hour from 9-10 and they still didn‚Äôt turn up and we didn‚Äôt want to waste more time on our holiday. We ended up paying for the room and breakfast which we feel is not justified given all the problems we had with this hotel.

The place is clean, has a pleasant lobby with a reading room on the side. The restaurant on the top floor is good; this is important because the restaurant choices in the neighbourhood are limited. I had laundry done, and they did a good job for a low price. As for location, it's within walking distance of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities and Tahrir Square. The staff is mostly very helpful, BUT... anybody who has traveled in Egypt knows that the quality of customer service varies greatly. In my case, when I was checking out, the woman at the desk told me I had to pay cash. I said, OK, no problem, where's the nearest bank machine? She said, ""banks are closed on Sunday."" That, of course, was a ridiculous response. Fortunately, another employee within earshot said that there was an ATM around the corner. Turned out that he was wrong, too. There are actually two ATM's a half block down the street. So no problem, but you really have to wonder, how can somebody work in a place and not be aware of where the nearest ATM is? It's important to know that the reception desk is actually on the tenth floor. This isn't an issue during the daytime, because there's a desk at the building entrance. However, if you arrive at 3:30 AM like I did, that desk will be unmanned. I had to bang on the elevator door for a while before the front desk guy became aware of my presence. The staff should really advise people of this when they book for late arrival. Finally, most taxi drivers don't know where the Osiris is. This is no surprise, because most Cairo taxi drivers don't know where anything else is, either. But be sure to have the hotel's business card with you to show the driver, and have the hotel's location on the GPS app on your cell phone.‚Ä¶"

The staff was considerate, helpful, flexible, and exceptionally kind. Whatever I needed, they were incredibly helpful and very welcoming. They were never pushy! While everyone there was wonderful, I'd like to especially thank Carlos, Abed, and Mina for making my stay wonderful. (Oh, and their English was excellent.) The location was great - right in the center of everything yet quiet. The breakfast (included) was very good, as was the dinner, all on the rooftop with a great view of the city. The staff at Osiris really made my vacation great. Highly recommended."

The cleaners come and clean your room on a daily basis is you wish.  The wifi is great too.  The location is excellent as it is down town and right by Tahrir Square so close to the Egyptian Museum and the underground so very quick and easy to get to Giza.

It is totally dirty. We are a party of four, but when we arrived, we were given a room with three beds. They told us that the following day they would give us a room for four. That never happened! Then, when we got into the room, we discovered that there was hot water but the shower didn't work. There was neither toilet paper nor soap and just one towel four us all. A hairdryer? Impossible!! Two days after our arrival, we had a plumber working in our room for more than an hour till he could fix the shower. We didn't have WIFI in the room, only in the common areas. It seems that it is a building where people rent rooms permanently as we never met other tourists. The worst of all was that men were all day smoking in the common areas. The supposed ""hotel"" is on the 5th floor, but to use the lift you need someone from there to activate it with a card, so we had to go up and down the stairs a great many times. We went to Luxor for two days, and when we came back, we were given the same room, but this time there was no hot water. Please NEVER EVER RESERVE THIS NASTY PLACE!!‚Ä¶"

The room and furnishings were dated, the bathroom floor leaked water daily, the hot water ran out after 2 showers. The tap had 2 positions, over the sink and barely over the sink and shampoo was not enough for 4, given in small packets. The safe didn‚Äôt work so taping the batteries in became the answer by the staff, who although kind, really haven‚Äôt fixed any of the problems mentioned in reviews on this or other booking sites. Nonetheless, the taped batteries fell out and we had to call staff again.  The air conditioner was filthy and the window above the lower window didn‚Äôt close so all the noise came in. Breakfast was a measly smorgasbord of bread, boiled eggs and tea or coffee, the same daily.  Pickup from the airport is free if staying more than 2 nights.

Located in Zamalek Cairo, this hotel is ok situated, about 1hr or so from airport.   Local area is good for restaurants, banks, pharmacies, and grocery store.   The foyer is not bad.  There is a restaurant on top floor, they have decent food, but very slow service.   The bar at ground level is dodgy, I ordered beer paid and the barman kept an extra 100LE.  I was adamant I paid correct amount and was expecting my money back, he denied I gave extra.  After he pulled money out of his pocket it was determined he owed me the 100LE, will not go there again.     The first room I had was a twin bed street facing.  Ok room, working AC, and bathroom ok.  Very noisy from street as no seals on windows, lots of honking.   Another room later, was river facing, and more upscale, but had smell of smoke.   All in all I had ok sleep, via putting in ear plugs. Elevators are tiny.   Breakfast is on mezz level, they have buffet and ok service.  Does trick to get going for day.     This place is not luxury, but is average, not bad for starting out in Cairo.‚Ä¶"

Classic interior, huge & clean rooms and cozy bar at ground floor. Amazing views to the Nile. It misses a gym, but there are a couple of choices walking distance. It's a legendary place with tons of day and night leisure destinations nearby.  In short, it‚Äôs a great hotel, in a great location with excellent value for money.  PS. Don‚Äôt miss out on the breakfast."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301551-Reviews-Golden_Tulip_Flamenco_Hotel_Flamenco_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Hotel is very rusty and suffocating. It is near the Nile River but located very noisy place. You can hardly open your window. Air Conditioner was extremly noisy you can sleep. Two other guests with us also said this. The brealfast is poor and tasteless. I have to say that staff was nice and helpful. Keep away from this hotel.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301551-Reviews-Golden_Tulip_Flamenco_Hotel_Flamenco_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Stayed for five days in August. Conveniently located on Zamalek. Bar and restaurant areas are welcoming. Excellent views from the top floor. Staff were all very helpful. Highly recommend the chicken burger!

I cannot fault the hotel in anyway, our stay was perfect. Staff were welcoming and helpful. We arrived way before check in at 11:30 and they had a room already ready for us which was perfect and allowed us to freshen up before visiting the pyramids.   The room itself was smart, bed comfy and bathroom was good size with a bath.   Hotel location is also great situated in a safe/good neighbourhood so your stay should be trouble free.   We didn‚Äôt get a chance to check out the bar or restaurant but good to know these are available."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I am sharing my experience so any future guests will be aware when booking at Tolip Golden Plaza. I stayed twice in less than a month, and the same issues were never fixed, and more rising issues justify the decline in their rating score. They are far from hospitality, lack experience, have low self-esteem at the front desk personnel, and have bad management. I stayed on 10/27/22 in room#10 by the pool. The reservation was made over the phone, we got there a little after 11 pm the check-in with the front desk guy named Ahmed was the longest check-in I have ever experienced. As I was at the front desk for the longest time guests who checked in before me were all coming to the front desk to address their issue with their room key card that wasn‚Äôt working some of them were very frustrated about going back and forth to the front desk for 2 or 3 times. Finally, he checked me in after almost 50 mins and warned me that my room key card might not work because they were having an issue with the key card programming machine and no IT person on duty in the morning it should be fixed but to let them know if I had any issues with it. Unfortunately walked to the pool area and got to my room and the key card didn‚Äôt work had to walk back and they kept me waiting for another 15 mins till Ahmed and another guy walked with me back to my room and kept trying the spare which also gave them hard time and after a while, it opened and they told us that most likely you will have the same issue if you leave again tonight and come back so they advise us to use the sliding doors for the balcony to exit and when we come back. The sliding doors weren‚Äôt even locking so anyone really can walk into your room. The bed closer to the closet was sliding on the room floor tile because the bed legs weren‚Äôt locking. The balcony is overseeing the pool area but the room door is overseeing the tennis court which they allow guests to use late after midnight and it gets pretty loud. The next morning went to sit on the balcony and found the plastic chairs have sticky stains on them and lots of ants. Called room service 4 times to get someone to iron my shirt because no iron in the room. Forgot sweatpants (Nautica navy blue) in the bathroom and when called they said they will check and get back to me no one did. I am a strong believer in second chances so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt I booked again on 11/18/22, I tried to book it over the phone but they said no rooms were available but online is showing that you do have availability so they asked me to book online on a 3rd party website. I originally booked a single room but later my dad decided to join me on the trip so I called them to change to a double room they said I can only do that when I check in but I was afraid they will be sold out so I asked the guy on the phone to put a note on my reservation to transfer to a double room which he said he did and told me it will $20 extra. I went to check in and it was the same front desk guy Ahmed from before. He asked us to be seated for 5 mins till he finishes the group check-in, we waited for 30 mins, and he also started helping other people who just came so I got up and got in the line too. The line wasn‚Äôt moving at all and another front desk was available so I asked him to check me in, his name was Omar he couldn‚Äôt locate my reservation I showed him the confirmation he called someone else who wasn‚Äôt wearing the same uniform looks like he already finished his shift. He wasn‚Äôt too happy he went to the back office and Omar asked me again to be seated for 5 mins I replied I already sat down for 30 mins and I have my dad who is 76 years old and I need to get him to the room, he told me I promise it will be 5 mins. Then he called me in and said that we don‚Äôt have any double rooms and that my booking was for a single room. I had to explain to him that I spoke to someone on the phone to upgrade and they suppose to be left a note on the account so he said let me see what I can do, then he was trying to use the staple but it was out and he said ‚Äúwhat an awful night‚Äù in his language (heya Leila Zarka) kept going back and forth for a staple then sat down the paper on the counter went to the back office again then came back saying it‚Äôs my lucky night we found you a double room. It was room 737, asked me for the $20 gave him the card, but the credit card terminal is out then asked if I have cash. He unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked. I asked to have 3 key cards since we are 2 in the room and he said only 1. Finally checked in, five mins being in the room phone is ringing Nourhan from guest relations asked if everything was okay and I addressed the inconvenience of a lengthy check-in time that goes for almost an hr that I never experienced anywhere else, she said she will let the manager know and went out an hour later with my dad when we came back we noticed the bed closer to the window is caved in so I let my dad sleep on the other bed. I woke up at 4 am to use the bathroom and my back is sore from the metal springs in the mattress I had to fold my bedspread in 4 to make up enough layers to fill in the mattress bow. The next morning I left the key on the counter at the front desk and walked away but the guy was trying to ask me to wait while finishing another guest, I told him I don‚Äôt need a receipt. This place isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be and is managed by a bunch of inexperienced people who knew nothing about the hospitality business.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,We stayed 4 nights during a tour in Egypt and the hotel didn't disappoint us. The twin room was very comfortable and spacious with a view over the city.   The breakfast buffet was AMAZING! A huge spread. Loved the fava bean porridge and accompaniments and falafel!    There is a huge shopping mall 10min walk from the hotel.  I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to have a comfortable stay in Cairo.    
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Really one of the worst hotel I stayed in all over the world especially the front desk staff‚Ä¶ quality of food and restaurant Om service is absolutely low. I wouldn‚Äôt advise anyone to stay in such low level hotel. On top of that it doesn‚Äôt worth such value for 5 stars hotel
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"amazing service, and great cleaning in a short amount of time . and very kind hearted people and if i ever came to Egypt again i would for sure come back to this hotel . and a . special thanks for iman"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Customer service is not as expected at all . Room is clean.  A call for slipper responded in 2 hours.   The receptionist was very polite but nothing is professional  ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù@@@@@@@ am still staying for another 4 rooms will keep reporting good and bad in a way to enhance it
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"My family of six children, ny wife and myself arrived for the first time in Egypt and were looking forward to a pleasant stay at the five star hotel- Tolip golden plaza hotel  On our arrival we were told that we did not have a booking which was untrue and then we were told that our booking was for one room and not three . We got that sorted out ,which took some time , and they found our booking but then we found out that the rooms were all smoking  rooms. This was despite making sure we requested  three NON SMOKING rooms on our o line booking. On entering the rooms,  two of them were absolutely  disgusting . The stench of cigarette smoke was foul and overpowering  and my daughter, who suffers from allergies and has sensitive skin, was finding it hard to cope. We are not unreasonable and one room was adequate so we left our sons in there. When we spoke to the reception,  we were told that they would find us other rooms.  We said as long as two rooms were on the same floor that was fine so our daughters could be with us. They told us that that two rooms on the same floor were available. They gave us only one room .   My wife and myself took that upper floor and my daughters were waiting in the smoking room as we had been told they would be moved imminently.   They sat in their travelling clothes without relaxing waiting with their suitcases.   I then went down to sort it out.  At reception i was met with hostile and unhelpful staff members who avoided eye contact with me . Again i was assured someone was going to come and the new room was being prepared.  We were assured that it would be ready promptly within the hour .   An hour passed with nobody dealing with our issue. On phoning down to reception and asking again we were told five minutes and that passed too.   We phoned again and kept on hold until they said someone was coming.   Someone from housekeeping did indeed come then and took my daughters to a room which was ANOTHER smoking room and not only that but was the room that my wife and I had vacated!    Another call to reception and we were told someone was dealing with it and to be patient .  Another hour passed and then another Finally i fell asleep  with my wife and daughters still waiting for a room.   Imagine how tired we all were and how exhasted .   Finally at around 2 in the morning my wife had had enough and went down to reception almost in tears, fatigued and angry. There- one member who had just come on shift  finally gave her a clean non smoking room  but on another floor -with assurances that the following day we would be given another room hopefully on our floor once people had checked out.   Imagine our  surprise when we did not get that room and no one even asked us about it!  We gave up at that point and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave the place.   Three rooms on three different floors. I wasn‚Äôt able to keep an eye on my young children and my daughters . It is totally unacceptable and so unbecoming to a hotel that boasts five stars.   Cleaning staff and housekeeping were more friendly and helpful than front desk. They were the rudest and most unhelpful people I could have hoped to meet and for staff who were supposed to deal with clients in the hospitality business they were totally unsuited to their profession. I never want to go to that hotel again - the experience was terrible and gave such  a bad impression of Egypt. As a frequent flyer I have been around the world and it is not an exaggeration to say that this hotels front desk staff was the worst I have experienced in any of the countries I have been in terms of attitude and behaviour . Perhaps some retraining in the art of hospitality might be in order .‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The place is difficult to reach. The entrance is obscure.  The reception is chaotic. Personnel are evasive and generally unhelpful. The staff are just too stiff! Toilets are sub-optimal regarding cleanliness. The meeting room and the parking are OK. The price is not cheap either.  Generally would not recommend except as a last resort. 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Booked 2 rooms through Agoda for 3 adults and 1 child of 14y. At check in, we were told that the booking was for only 1 double and 1 single and that I had to pay for the child. We were not agreeable and contacted Agoda which sorted it out. Breakfast was good and filling. There are lots of restaurants nearby to eat. We didn't use any of the facilities."
