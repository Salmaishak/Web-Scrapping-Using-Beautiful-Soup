Spring Hotel Luxor,4.5,EGP 906,",Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)","Ramla Street West Bank, Luxor 85111 Egypt",We had the most amazing stay! Ashraf was a fantastic host and hooked us up with some really great activities in the area for good prices. The location is perfect since the West Bank has the majority of the ancient ruins and is more quiet / relaxed than the east bank. The ferry boats are also right outside the door and are very affordable if you do ever want to go to the east bank for a day or night. Make sure to rent a bike from the hotel and cruise to the lesser known temples and tombs of the West Bank. It’s very safe and you can go at your own pace. Enjoy Luxor!

The drinks are very expensive, almost £20 for a small beer and a small wine. As a result one would expect great service. The drinks were placed on the table. We were provided with some nuts which had been overrated and tasted rather burnt. The staff could not wait to get rid of us it felt as the minute we put our glass down they removed it. This was not five star service but was five star pricing. We would have stayed longer and eaten lunch if the service had been better but it was very disappointing."

It looks so ancient and dirty.

The ship is in very good condition.  Of all the other boats we saw during our cruise, the BlueShadow appeared the newest and in the best condition. The ship is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating.    The cabins are well-furnished, modern, and spacious (larger than those found on mega cruise ships). Our room had a large window and flatscreen TV, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a shower/tub combo and there is ample closet space.   We traveled in July, with outside temps of 113 degrees Farenheit.  The boat is kept cool, almost too cool.  I recommend that you pack a sweatshirt or fleece for the common areas as the AC is blasting nearly non-stop. It made for a refreshing contrast when returning from the boat after several hours signtseeing in the intense Egyptian summer heat.  The food service is good for a boat of this size. All meal service is buffet style, and there is sufficient variety such that you should be able to find a food to your liking.  The daily Egyptian Dish specials were particularly good. Wait staff was attentive with clearing plates and serving beverages.  Water is not included, but a 1.5L bottle costs less than $2 US. We spent about $20 US total on water for the entire four-day cruise, which I thought was reasonable. The sun deck has ample space and a small pool to cool off in. We spent hours reclined under the canopy watching life unfold on the banks of the river.  It was very tranquil and provided a unique perspective on life in Egypt  outside Cairo.  This is THE way to see Egypt, both ancient and modern.  I recommend this trip and this cruise line to anyone who wishes to see all that Egypt has to offer.…"

There were ceiling fans and new air conditioning units to keep the place cool.  The bedroom was also large and offered a lot of storage space.  The bathroom was clean and offered great water pressure.  The Wifi worked very well.  Best of all, the host is extremely kind and helpful.  He offered to help me in anything I needed.  He even stayed awake until 1:00 in the morning to sort out some issues I had with the taxi upon departure.  The apartment is located in a very quiet area of the Nile West Bank.  About a 5-minute walk away is a grocery store.

Les Appartements De La Concorde,5.0,,,,We have had an excellent stay in this large house located in the tombs' side of Luxor. Obviously this is a bit far from the center and quite isolated; but this is largely compensated by the lovely room we had with great views and large / confrotable bedrooms. The owners are French / Egyptian and very helpful.  Highly recommended for families and anyone willing to escape Luxor and enjoy this beautiful area (bikes can be hired).

The apartments are really well appointed and spotlessly clean. An added bonus is the spacious roof terrace which gives splendid views over the Nile to Luxor in one direction and to the Theban Hills in the other. To be up teher at dawn or under moonlight is a truly unforgettable experience (see photos).The position is very convenient for visiting all the sites of the west bank and catching the ferry over to Luxor, There are a number of good cafes and restaurants within walking distance at both Ramlah and Gezira. The owners are lovelypeople and really easy to contact to make additional arrangements such as hiring bikes which we did on this occasion. The swimming pool is great for a refreshing dip after a day visiting temples. I could go on but, to be honest, part of me doesn't even want to write a review because I'd rather keep these apartments as my own little secret ;-)…"
