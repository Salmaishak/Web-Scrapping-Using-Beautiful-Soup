I have spent hundreds of days there over the last 30 years. I spent a lot of 2020 here, as my apartment was being renovated. The staff made me feel it was my second home.  The hotel is thoroughly cleaned every day. It was redecorated in the last couple years. The building is 1920s style, with high ceilings, balconies with great views of the city, ceiling fans, and lots of charm. The old, original elevator works well--it might take some getting used to, but it is regularly maintained, so you can count on it. If it ever does not work once, the owner gets it checked right away, because he won't be able to stay in business without it. If you find the stairways dirty or the airshaft dirty--these things are typical in Egypt and not something the hotel can do anything about, since they own the eighth floor, but not the building.  The owner, Ashraf, is very kind and accommodating to your needs, as well as an excellent source of information about any where you need to go, how to renew your visa, how to open a bank account, and whatever else you need. The staff are respectful and very honest.   Breakfast is bread, cheese and jam, plus an egg! Most budget places in Egypt don't include an egg. Cold drinks, water, tea and coffee are available at cheap prices. If you want to order a full Egyptian breakfast, it is excellent and not very expensive. Plus with the app ""Talabat,"" you can order from hundreds of area restaurants, if you don't feel like going out. Reception staff can help you order.  There are two suites with AC and a bathroom inside. The other rooms can some with a bathroo or you share the bathrooms, but many are available and cleaned multiple times a day. The bathtubs are clean, but old. It's time to redo the porcelain on them. But they work well and are clean.  You can hang out in the reception area to meet other travelers. They are mostly students, budget travelers an occasional businessman from Saudi. If you want any tour, Ashraf can arrange it, as well as transportation wherever you want, including the airport. He is very honest, which is sometimes not easy to find in Egypt.  The location is the best! Busses and a Metro stop are right in front of you, while taxis are plentiful and not expensive. There are new Uber busses or Svwl busses or cars you can book on apps for fair prices.  The balcony views of Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum or the old American University of Cairo campus are fantastic.  Bring earplugs, because Cairo never sleeps, so everywhere is noisy all night.…"

The service was the best, better than any 5 star- literally. Any issues, they come right away, the housekeeping was extremely helpful and on top of everything with personalized service, the concierge very helpful, and the reception very polite and courteous. When my daughter got stain on the walls the manager was very courteous and accommodating. They also brought for me flowers and fruit per my family's request.  I took a 3 bedroom suite which was an apartment. Each bedroom had a queen size bed. There was also a dining area, salon area, kitchen, and bathroom. The style was a bit outdated but the availability and convenience of everything made up for it. There was microwave, fridge, toaster, oven, kitchenware, ironing board, tv, and desks.   I appreciated the cleanliness- everything was covered in plastic and sanitized.   Breakfast was very basic with boiled egg, jam, bread, cheese, OJ, tea/nescafe.   Delivery is easy through talabat app where I ordered things from the pharmacy and other restaurants. The hotel is keen about safety so no delivery persons come to the room, instead the concierge will carry up the item and you give him the money. I made sure to leave a tip for both him and the person delivering.  There are also a few restaurants and cafes downstairs although I didn't try any. One is particularly famous in Maadi for breakfast called Ovio (?).  The location is quiet, removed from the hustle and bustle of Cairo, and a view of trees and greenery specific to Maadi. I loved the balcony to relax in.   I totally recommend this hotel for short or extended stay. Special thanks to Mr. Sayed the manager, Ms. Asmaa the receptionist, Ms. Heba the housekeeper, Mr. Nour/Nouh the concierge. Excellent service and help from them.…"

This cool dude gave me loads of tour options (even for other cities like Aswan and Luxor), helped me exchange currency, arranged transportation. Between them and the very helpful Moustafa and Mary there's always someone at front desk, eager to assist.  There's a ton to do around this area. One can walk over to the the Museum, Tahrir Square, Nasr Metro Station, Bo Bus station or the Nile in about 10 minutes. My room was surprisingly quiet considering the busy location! The railway station is about 1km away. Countless shopping and food options in the neighborhood - from touristy to very local stuff!  The general vibe at the hotel is very welcoming, laid back and casual. They serve breakfast and even offered to customize it for me. There's a shared kitchen and plenty of seating in the lobby. The wifi is not the best, though it was being hogged by a few guests streaming videos all day. I found an unused wifi router in the hallway and set it up as a range extender. The hosts were immensely grateful!  Made some great connections with the hosts and fellow travelers as I lounged about the lobby, sipping some of their amazing shaay :) Special mention for Ahmed - the dashing young man who drove me all around Cairo, Giza, dropped me to the train station and even invited me for a home-cooked meal! Mr. Omar and Ibrahim are ambassadors of Egyptian hospitality. They made me feel like a guest and not a customer. It was almost too good to be true! They actually convinced me to return to Egypt!

The owner asked us to do the check-in in the ground floor, to pay (we trusted him) then to go the 20th floor to see our room. When we arrived to the 20th floor, the construction works were juste beside our room (photos attached). There was no private spa in the room and we need to cross the construction works to reach the ""common"" balcony ... We refused the room, and asked about something else, he told us that was the last room he has ... So we asked to cancel the reservation and to refund us the 140 € that we have just payed. The owner accepted and told us that he will refund us the full amount. Now one month later, the owner didn't refund us anything, he didn't answer my messages, my calls and my emails. We asked Booking. com to intervene, but Booking couldn't do anything as the owner asked us to pay by card in the hotel when we arrived, Booking considered the paiement has been done directly with the hotel. What a shame to have such an hotel in the ""Preferred Partners Properties"" Programmes of Booking.com. It is a real scam, the owner is not honest, what a shame for the nice Egyptian people to have such a scammer.…"

The only concern they had about me as their customer was the payment. But they couldn’t even handle a credit card machine. Well, one of the very unprofessional staff could but only after three days of my visit and when the machine was finally charged and could accept US Dollars, not Egyptian pounds (which worked everywhere else with my card). That was the start when arrived late first night. The room didn’t look ready at all, no toilet papers, no safety box, the mini bar was totally empty, no balcony as the description lied about. When I woke up it was even worse. Easily the dirtiest hotel ever. The bedclothes were ripped, had dirty stains AND pubic hair all over (in the shower as well). Smashed mosquitos/bugs on the walls, and the windows behind the curtains, jeez, I got almost sick only by looking how dirty they were. See picture. No organization whatsoever when it comes to clean up the room, if you don’t ask them nothing happens. After three days one of the staff asked me to change room since ”I’ve got a friend coming over”. Well, what about NO my friend I answered. The electricity went out about five times during my week, oh, and I left this horrible place in complete darkness since the lights went when I was just about to leave. Fawlty Towers, please come back, everything is forgiven!…"

Cuando inauguraron puede que fuera así, pero ahora esta en mal estado de conservación y muy muy sucio.  No hacen las habitaciones durante la estancia. No cierran las ventanas y entran un montón de mosquitos. Están los cadáveres en las paredes pegados porque no limpian. Matamos unos 15 y todavia nos picaron 15 más. El desayuno muy muy pobre. Los encargados del hotel se unieron a la fiesta de una de las habitaciones y aun pidiéndoles que queríamos dormir pasaron de nosotros y estuvieron toda la noche de risas y música alta. No descansamos nada."

It is very clean compared to what you find outside on the streets, so if you want your oasis of cleaness in Cairo, you have found it. The staff is very friendly, always helpful and welcoming. Mr. Robert will always check up with you to see if you are ok or need anything. Breakfast is basic but hearty. They will not be pushy to sell you any tours as other hotels do. They really care about the guests needs and even did the laundry for free without accepting any money for it. The housekeeping is sometimes too loud on the corridor early in the morning."
