It took a lot of work to get dry sheets from the front desk, as they seemed completely uninterested in helping us, and then we had to remake our now wet bed. Not only that, I think someone smoked in our room while cleaning it. The lobby constantly smelled strongly of cheap perfume covering up cigarette smoke.

I often stayed there as a single woman in Cairo, and they always took good care of me! I have spent hundreds of days there over the last 30 years. I spent a lot of 2020 here, as my apartment was being renovated. The staff made me feel it was my second home.  The hotel is thoroughly cleaned every day. It was redecorated in the last couple years. The building is 1920s style, with high ceilings, balconies with great views of the city, ceiling fans, and lots of charm. The old, original elevator works well--it might take some getting used to, but it is regularly maintained, so you can count on it. If it ever does not work once, the owner gets it checked right away, because he won't be able to stay in business without it. If you find the stairways dirty or the airshaft dirty--these things are typical in Egypt and not something the hotel can do anything about, since they own the eighth floor, but not the building.  The owner, Ashraf, is very kind and accommodating to your needs, as well as an excellent source of information about any where you need to go, how to renew your visa, how to open a bank account, and whatever else you need. The staff are respectful and very honest.   Breakfast is bread, cheese and jam, plus an egg! Most budget places in Egypt don't include an egg. Cold drinks, water, tea and coffee are available at cheap prices. If you want to order a full Egyptian breakfast, it is excellent and not very expensive. Plus with the app ""Talabat,"" you can order from hundreds of area restaurants, if you don't feel like going out. Reception staff can help you order.  There are two suites with AC and a bathroom inside. The other rooms can some with a bathroo or you share the bathrooms, but many are available and cleaned multiple times a day. The bathtubs are clean, but old. It's time to redo the porcelain on them. But they work well and are clean.  You can hang out in the reception area to meet other travelers. They are mostly students, budget travelers an occasional businessman from Saudi. If you want any tour, Ashraf can arrange it, as well as transportation wherever you want, including the airport. He is very honest, which is sometimes not easy to find in Egypt.  The location is the best! Busses and a Metro stop are right in front of you, while taxis are plentiful and not expensive. There are new Uber busses or Svwl busses or cars you can book on apps for fair prices.  The balcony views of Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum or the old American University of Cairo campus are fantastic.

The girl from reception started to speak with us for check-in, after somebody else comes (an egyptian) and let us just like this, for 10 minute, without no information.  All of them want money from everything. They showed a book with some activities that they organize (Giza Piramids, Cairo) and when we said ""thank you"" politely, because we already booked, she started to do some facial expressions... The room was dirty, we found some packages near the windows... Unfortunately, I did not take some pictures. Also, they start to serve the breakfast after 9, 9.30, we said that we need to go to visit and the visits starts early in the morning, but just they don't care. It was needed me to yell to him to have the breakfast at 8.30 (an acceptable hour, after me). And, the last lie was the transfer to airport. They proposed us to get to airport and we accepted (for 250 LE - triple than the Uber). We also asked and paid one more night there till our flight (that was at 4am) because my husband twisted his ankle. We agreed with them to get us at 00.30 (so, with a lot of time in advance) from hotel. The girl told us that it takes one hour to arrive at the airport. At 23, they came to our door saying that 'the driver is already here and the way to airport is very crowded'. I said that i think it's ok because we have tine until the flight, but to be sure, we accepted to leave at 00.00. After 20 minutes, they came back and said that we need to go now because the way is blocked because of some works. They hurry us to leave the room (even if we paid the completely night). My thought is that they did not register the payment (all was cash) and all of them kept the money for one night (624 LE). And guess what, we made 20 minutes till the airport ...no trafic and no works. All was a lie just to make us leave faster. As i said before, i think that they shared the money between them.  I do NOT recomand this hotel. For us, it was an horrible experience. They ALL want just our money without making a minimum of attention to us.  Thanks, Ioana Dumitrescu…",Cairo

When my daughter got stain on the walls the manager was very courteous and accommodating. They also brought for me flowers and fruit per my family's request.  I took a 3 bedroom suite which was an apartment. Each bedroom had a queen size bed. There was also a dining area, salon area, kitchen, and bathroom. The style was a bit outdated but the availability and convenience of everything made up for it. There was microwave, fridge, toaster, oven, kitchenware, ironing board, tv, and desks.   I appreciated the cleanliness- everything was covered in plastic and sanitized.   Breakfast was very basic with boiled egg, jam, bread, cheese, OJ, tea/nescafe.   Delivery is easy through talabat app where I ordered things from the pharmacy and other restaurants. The hotel is keen about safety so no delivery persons come to the room, instead the concierge will carry up the item and you give him the money. I made sure to leave a tip for both him and the person delivering.  There are also a few restaurants and cafes downstairs although I didn't try any. One is particularly famous in Maadi for breakfast called Ovio (?).  The location is quiet, removed from the hustle and bustle of Cairo, and a view of trees and greenery specific to Maadi.

Cairo International Hostel Downtown,3.0,"EGP 1,066",,"9 Adly 5th floor, Cairo 11511 Egypt","Commençons par les points positifs… ou plutôt l’unique point positif : la localisation en plein cœur du centre ville, idéal pour rayonner à pieds, voiture, ou métro. L’arrivée à « l’hôtel » se fait par l’une des artères principales du cente-ville, ou par une petite ruelle au charme « coupe-gorge », si vous arrivez du mauvais côté. Arrivés en bas du bâtiment, nous n’avons trouvé aucune indication/pancarte confirmant la présence de l’établissement, et c’est grâce aux avis laissés sur différents sites que nous nous sommes rendus au 5eme étage pour le check-in. Prenant possession de notre chambre, nous avons pu constater que les draps étaient sales (présence de nombreuses tâches et cheveux/poils de précédents occupants, Cf photos). Malgré tout, et fatigués d’une intense journée, nous nous sommes empressés d’aller nous coucher et avons immédiatement noté l’absence totale d’insonorisation, résultant en une charmante nuit blanche. Le centre-ville du Caire ressemble à un gigantesque cortège de mariage avec ses coups de klaxons incessants de 6h à 1h30, s’en suivent les aboiements des chiens errants de 1h30 à 4h30-5h et enfin l’appel à la prière. Autant dire si vous aspirez à passer une nuit paisible, un autre établissement avec un minimum d’insonorisation sera tout indiqué. Pour passer le temps durant ces nombreuses heures à tourner et retourner dans notre lit, nous avons été gratifiés de multiples démangeaisons ne laissant guère de doute sur leur origine : de belles piqûres en rang d’oignons témoignant de la présence de punaises de lit plutôt voraces. Si vous êtes malgré tout tentés de séjourner dans ce lieu immonde, assurez-vous que votre gabarit vous permette de profiter des toilettes sans vous cogner dans le mur se trouvant face à vous (idéal pour travailler un mouvement de squats bien vertical). Attention également aux bouteilles d’eau fournies par l’établissement qui sont en réalité des bouteilles de récupération remplies à la fontaine : si la tourista vous effraie, nous vous recommandons plutôt de vous approvisionner à l’épicerie située au bout de la petite ruelle précédemment évoquée. En résumé, à fuir ! Le tarif, même bas, ne suffit pas à occulter tous les aspects négatifs de ce lieu que je n’oserais qualifier d’hôtel, d’hostel ni même de refuge.…",Cairo

The furniture is yellowed, there are scratches on the wood.  Everything makes a loveless and unkempt impression.  Without ventilation, the rooms are fine. Even a window was broken. Breakfast only on demand and normally only from 9. Then it takes half an hour.  Who wants to leave early for the sights should wake up early and hope that e. g. a guy from the reception “feels able” to prepare some breakfast (which was always bread, cheese, foul, a salad that’s all).

Hotel Velvet 1889,1.0,"EGP 2,337",,"118 Mohammed Farid Street, Cairo 00202 Egypt","My stay at Velvet 1889 was the worst hotel stay of my life so far. The receptionist refused giving me bed covers and told me to turn the A/C on instead. It is February, and it's Cairo nights are incredibly chilly. When I contacted the customer service, they told me the same thing and the A/C would be more than enough! I felt completely humiliated and dehumanised. The bedsheets had body hairs stuck to them and the towel I was given was already wet. I had to cut my stay short and leave the hotel at 12 a.m. to go and look for somewhere else where I could even have the luxury of having blankets. When I came out of the room, I found that the receptionist was putting together bedsheets for me to use as make-do blankets. The experience was disappointing through and through.

He only had one room available for just one night, so he let me take it with a good rate. He advised me to check again next day, and luckily they had a cancellation, so I continued my stay in another room.  Both rooms were clean, nicely furnished in a traditional style. Beds were very comfortable. Hot water was always available. Cleaning lady was doing a great job. All staff I met were super friendly and went out of their way to assist.  The location is convenient.

It is off a busy highway & around the corner from a ladies club. If this doesnt raise your suspicions about this being the wrong Regency Hotel perhaps the hand painted hotel sign will.  Room 506 has seen better days about a decade ago. After enjoying the release of emptying my bowels the toilet wouldnt flush & there wasnt any toilet paper. There was a 28cm tv, mini fridge & aircon. Bedsheets looked sort of gungy & the carpet was fairly dirty. The reception dudes spoke little english but knew how to ask for tips. I played a game of charades with them to try & explain the toilet problem. It was very entertaining, we eventually changed rooms to an equally poor room.  The hotel is housed in the sort of neighbourhood you would go to if you were homeless. Stray dogs & garbage are the main features here if you like to take photos. There are no computers in the hotel, the reception desk used paper & pen! The 80's has come back in fashion here.  The hotel resturant has cobbwebs on the locked door, this is probably not good so avoid even asking for food, just call KFC for takeaway 19019.  The previous review from 2 years ago basically describes our experience word for word, so in 2 years nothing had improved, indeed its pretty shabby.

Le personnel n'est pas du tout souriant et très peu aimable. Très loin de l'hospitalité africaine. L'accueil est inexistant.   Première fois en 15 ans que je tombe sur un hôtel aussi médiocre.  Scandaleux et honteux de mettre des descriptions non conformes.  1/ À quelques heures de s'enregistrer (une fois que l'annulation n'est plus possible) on reçoit un mail pour nous signaler que l'hôtel n'est réservé qu'aux égyptiens et que les nourritures et boissons extérieures sont complètement interdites dans l'enceinte. Aucuns de ces points n'aient signalés lors de la réservation ou sur le descriptif en ligne.  2/ Surprise au moment de s'enregistrer, le prix bloqué à la réservation à augmenté de 15% et l'hôtesse nous apprend qu'on doit ajouter 60$ à ce prix car nous sommes non résidents égyptiens.  DES VOLEURS!!   Face à notre refus d'ajouter autant elle baisse la somme de 70% en quelques secondes (taxe à la tête du client!!! Honteux !  3/ Ils proposent soit disant des chambres doubles mais au moment de découvrir la chambre on s'aperçoit qu'elle est avec 2 lits simples, on appelle l'accueil pour signaler que ce n'est pas ce que nous avions réservés. L'hôtesse nous répond simplement que dans cet hôtel toutes les chambres sont en lits séparés.   4/ La chambre est sommaire.   Odeur d'humidité et marque d'humidité sur les murs   Quant à la literie, elle n'est pas du tout confortable.  Juste une serviette de toilette, pas de serviettes pour les mains, cheveux ou même de tapis de bain...

I booked the Nile dinner cruise in Cairo, a Giza pyramid tour and a 4 day Aswan/Luxor cruise.The guides were not always very thorough and I never knew what was coming next.   DO NOT book Aswan/Luxor activities through them.  I paid almost double what other people on the cruise paid(use visitor it was legit and a good price).
