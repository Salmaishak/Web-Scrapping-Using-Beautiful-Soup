Downtown, Cairo 11511 Egypt","I love this little hotel. I often stayed there as a single woman in Cairo, and they always took good care of me! I have spent hundreds of days there over the last 30 years. I spent a lot of 2020 here, as my apartment was being renovated. The staff made me feel it was my second home.  The hotel is thoroughly cleaned every day. It was redecorated in the last couple years. The building is 1920s style, with high ceilings, balconies with great views of the city, ceiling fans, and lots of charm. The old, original elevator works well--it might take some getting used to, but it is regularly maintained, so you can count on it. If it ever does not work once, the owner gets it checked right away, because he won't be able to stay in business without it. If you find the stairways dirty or the airshaft dirty--these things are typical in Egypt and not something the hotel can do anything about, since they own the eighth floor, but not the building.  The owner, Ashraf, is very kind and accommodating to your needs, as well as an excellent source of information about any where you need to go, how to renew your visa, how to open a bank account, and whatever else you need. The staff are respectful and very honest.   Breakfast is bread, cheese and jam, plus an egg! Most budget places in Egypt don't include an egg. Cold drinks, water, tea and coffee are available at cheap prices. If you want to order a full Egyptian breakfast, it is excellent and not very expensive. Plus with the app ""Talabat,"" you can order from hundreds of area restaurants, if you don't feel like going out. Reception staff can help you order.  There are two suites with AC and a bathroom inside. The other rooms can some with a bathroo or you share the bathrooms, but many are available and cleaned multiple times a day. The bathtubs are clean, but old. It's time to redo the porcelain on them. But they work well and are clean.  You can hang out in the reception area to meet other travelers. They are mostly students, budget travelers an occasional businessman from Saudi. If you want any tour, Ashraf can arrange it, as well as transportation wherever you want, including the airport. He is very honest, which is sometimes not easy to find in Egypt.  The location is the best! Busses and a Metro stop are right in front of you, while taxis are plentiful and not expensive. There are new Uber busses or Svwl busses or cars you can book on apps for fair prices.  The balcony views of Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum or the old American University of Cairo campus are fantastic.  Bring earplugs, because Cairo never sleeps, so everywhere is noisy all night.…"

He attracts you with a decent room price and free pick-ups but once you get there you'll pay exagerated prices.  - He charged me the breakfast even though on his website was clearly written that breakfast is included in the price of the room.  - For a soup and two pieces of chicken meat at lunch he charged minimum 7$, then he obviousely got very frustrated when he saw I bought food from the village the next days (as if I had to eat only the meals cooked by his family so that he could charge me more).  Pay attention because he is not telling you the prices at the beginning, he says ""yes yes no problem"", and at the end he claims exagerated prices (at least double than normal).  The climax was when I insisted to know the price for horse riding beforehand and he said 80$ for 2h (something absurd!) When I said I don't have so much left, he insisted going to an ATM as if I had to do that horse riding with him. The next day he insisted on giving him all my change because apparently I didn't need it because I was flying back home. He didn't care I had to pay toll road for my car, eat something before my flight, he only wanted more money for him, not caring of his guests needs (and decision).  I was happy to leave and wouldn't return there not even for free. It was the worst experience I had in Egypt. Mohamed is interested only in grabbing as much money as possible from you (at exorbitant prices). My advice is don't go there.…"

The service was the best, better than any 5 star- literally. Any issues, they come right away, the housekeeping was extremely helpful and on top of everything with personalized service, the concierge very helpful, and the reception very polite and courteous. When my daughter got stain on the walls the manager was very courteous and accommodating. They also brought for me flowers and fruit per my family's request.  I took a 3 bedroom suite which was an apartment. Each bedroom had a queen size bed. There was also a dining area, salon area, kitchen, and bathroom. The style was a bit outdated but the availability and convenience of everything made up for it. There was microwave, fridge, toaster, oven, kitchenware, ironing board, tv, and desks.   I appreciated the cleanliness- everything was covered in plastic and sanitized.   Breakfast was very basic with boiled egg, jam, bread, cheese, OJ, tea/nescafe.   Delivery is easy through talabat app where I ordered things from the pharmacy and other restaurants. The hotel is keen about safety so no delivery persons come to the room, instead the concierge will carry up the item and you give him the money. I made sure to leave a tip for both him and the person delivering.  There are also a few restaurants and cafes downstairs although I didn't try any. One is particularly famous in Maadi for breakfast called Ovio (?).  The location is quiet, removed from the hustle and bustle of Cairo, and a view of trees and greenery specific to Maadi. I loved the balcony to relax in.   I totally recommend this hotel for short or extended stay. Special thanks to Mr. Sayed the manager, Ms. Asmaa the receptionist, Ms. Heba the housekeeper, Mr. Nour/Nouh the concierge. Excellent service and help from them.…"
