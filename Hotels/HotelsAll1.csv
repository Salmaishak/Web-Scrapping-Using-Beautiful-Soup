Ismailia House Hotel,3.5,,,"1 El Tahrir Sq. Downtown, Cairo 11511 Egypt","I love this little hotel. I often stayed there as a single woman in Cairo, and they always took good care of me! I have spent hundreds of days there over the last 30 years. I spent a lot of 2020 here, as my apartment was being renovated. The staff made me feel it was my second home.  The hotel is thoroughly cleaned every day. It was redecorated in the last couple years. The building is 1920s style, with high ceilings, balconies with great views of the city, ceiling fans, and lots of charm. The old, original elevator works well--it might take some getting used to, but it is regularly maintained, so you can count on it. If it ever does not work once, the owner gets it checked right away, because he won't be able to stay in business without it. If you find the stairways dirty or the airshaft dirty--these things are typical in Egypt and not something the hotel can do anything about, since they own the eighth floor, but not the building.  The owner, Ashraf, is very kind and accommodating to your needs, as well as an excellent source of information about any where you need to go, how to renew your visa, how to open a bank account, and whatever else you need. The staff are respectful and very honest.   Breakfast is bread, cheese and jam, plus an egg! Most budget places in Egypt don't include an egg. Cold drinks, water, tea and coffee are available at cheap prices. If you want to order a full Egyptian breakfast, it is excellent and not very expensive. Plus with the app ""Talabat,"" you can order from hundreds of area restaurants, if you don't feel like going out. Reception staff can help you order.  There are two suites with AC and a bathroom inside. The other rooms can some with a bathroo or you share the bathrooms, but many are available and cleaned multiple times a day. The bathtubs are clean, but old. It's time to redo the porcelain on them. But they work well and are clean.  You can hang out in the reception area to meet other travelers. They are mostly students, budget travelers an occasional businessman from Saudi. If you want any tour, Ashraf can arrange it, as well as transportation wherever you want, including the airport. He is very honest, which is sometimes not easy to find in Egypt.  The location is the best! Busses and a Metro stop are right in front of you, while taxis are plentiful and not expensive. There are new Uber busses or Svwl busses or cars you can book on apps for fair prices.  The balcony views of Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum or the old American University of Cairo campus are fantastic.  Bring earplugs, because Cairo never sleeps, so everywhere is noisy all night.â€¦"

The hotel is keen about safety so no delivery persons come to the room, instead the concierge will carry up the item and you give him the money. I made sure to leave a tip for both him and the person delivering.  There are also a few restaurants and cafes downstairs although I didn't try any. One is particularly famous in Maadi for breakfast called Ovio (?).  The location is quiet, removed from the hustle and bustle of Cairo, and a view of trees and greenery specific to Maadi. I loved the balcony to relax in.   I totally recommend this hotel for short or extended stay. Special thanks to Mr. Sayed the manager, Ms. Asmaa the receptionist, Ms. Heba the housekeeper, Mr. Nour/Nouh the concierge. Excellent service and help from them.â€¦"

The owner asked us to do the check-in in the ground floor, to pay (we trusted him) then to go the 20th floor to see our room. When we arrived to the 20th floor, the construction works were juste beside our room (photos attached). There was no private spa in the room and we need to cross the construction works to reach the ""common"" balcony ... We refused the room, and asked about something else, he told us that was the last room he has ... So we asked to cancel the reservation and to refund us the 140 â‚¬ that we have just payed. The owner accepted and told us that he will refund us the full amount. Now one month later, the owner didn't refund us anything, he didn't answer my messages, my calls and my emails. We asked Booking. com to intervene, but Booking couldn't do anything as the owner asked us to pay by card in the hotel when we arrived, Booking considered the paiement has been done directly with the hotel. What a shame to have such an hotel in the ""Preferred Partners Properties"" Programmes of Booking.com. It is a real scam, the owner is not honest, what a shame for the nice Egyptian people to have such a scammer.â€¦"

La camera era abbastanza spaziosa con due letti comodi (col piumino imbottito). Non aveva balcone ma 2 finestre vista fiume. La posizione Ã¨  abbastanza vicina al centro ma fuori dal traffico quindi, tranne per un pochino di rumore dell'aria condizionata si dorme benissimo.  Il bagno Ã¨ rifatto da poco, quindi moderno anche se con qualche piccola pecca. Forniscono solo il sapone ma danno le ciabattine. La colazione viene servita in una terrazzina proprio sul fiume, con tanto di ventilatore. E' una colazione egiziana solo salata con dei falafel e le omelette cotte al momento, formaggio, verdure, pane egiziano e the o caffÃ¨. Il personale Ã¨ stato molto gentile, ci hanno accolto a notte fonda e l'autista che Ã¨ venuto a prenderci all'aeroporto ( per 18 euro) Ã¨ stato molto cordiale con un'ottima guida. Zona tranquilla. Certamente ci vuole un po' di spirito di adattamento, perchÃ¨ la pulizia non Ã¨ proprio agli standard che ci si aspetta e alcuni mobili sono un po' malandati (o coperti di cellophane, non so perchÃ¨!) ma in generale per il prezzo che ha ritengo sia una buona scelta di fascia  economica.â€¦"

Mr. Robert will always check up with you to see if you are ok or need anything. Breakfast is basic but hearty. They will not be pushy to sell you any tours as other hotels do. They really care about the guests needs and even did the laundry for free without accepting any money for it. The housekeeping is sometimes too loud on the corridor early in the morning."

My bunk bed was comfortable and roomy, though I suspect the room gets crowded when all the beds are taken.  The bunk has a personal plug, light and a shelf.  Bathroom was clean with good showers.   I left early, so didn't try the breakfast.  The hotel owner was my taxi driver to the airport, very easy.  I wish there was an indoor lounge with no smoking allowed. FYI there is no outdoor space, which would be a pain for a longer visit.  Front desk staff seems hit or miss."

Ambiance Cairo Hotel,2.0,,,"22 Talaat Harb Street Down Town, Cairo 11511 Egypt","Simply the worst hotel Iâ€™ve stayed at in 40 years. The only concern they had about me as their customer was the payment. But they couldnâ€™t even handle a credit card machine. Well, one of the very unprofessional staff could but only after three days of my visit and when the machine was finally charged and could accept US Dollars, not Egyptian pounds (which worked everywhere else with my card). That was the start when arrived late first night. The room didnâ€™t look ready at all, no toilet papers, no safety box, the mini bar was totally empty, no balcony as the description lied about. When I woke up it was even worse. Easily the dirtiest hotel ever. The bedclothes were ripped, had dirty stains AND pubic hair all over (in the shower as well). Smashed mosquitos/bugs on the walls, and the windows behind the curtains, jeez, I got almost sick only by looking how dirty they were. See picture. No organization whatsoever when it comes to clean up the room, if you donâ€™t ask them nothing happens. After three days one of the staff asked me to change room since â€Iâ€™ve got a friend coming overâ€. Well, what about NO my friend I answered. The electricity went out about five times during my week, oh, and I left this horrible place in complete darkness since the lights went when I was just about to leave. Fawlty Towers, please come back, everything is forgiven!â€¦"

Hotel Velvet 1889,1.0,,,"118 Mohammed Farid Street, Cairo 00202 Egypt","My stay at Velvet 1889 was the worst hotel stay of my life so far. The receptionist refused giving me bed covers and told me to turn the A/C on instead. It is February, and it's Cairo nights are incredibly chilly. When I contacted the customer service, they told me the same thing and the A/C would be more than enough! I felt completely humiliated and dehumanised. The bedsheets had body hairs stuck to them and the towel I was given was already wet. I had to cut my stay short and leave the hotel at 12 a.m. to go and look for somewhere else where I could even have the luxury of having blankets. When I came out of the room, I found that the receptionist was putting together bedsheets for me to use as make-do blankets. The experience was disappointing through and through. They did not even once apologize or show any vague understanding of human needs, such as having a warm place to sleep in in such a harsh winter!â€¦"

Sakkara Inn Hotel,4.5,,,"20 Sakkara Road Abu Sir, Cairo Egypt","Despite it is a nice and clean guesthouse with a beautiful garden, Mohamed the owner is the greediest person I have ever met. He attracts you with a decent room price and free pick-ups but once you get there you'll pay exagerated prices.  - He charged me the breakfast even though on his website was clearly written that breakfast is included in the price of the room.  - For a soup and two pieces of chicken meat at lunch he charged minimum 7$, then he obviousely got very frustrated when he saw I bought food from the village the next days (as if I had to eat only the meals cooked by his family so that he could charge me more).  Pay attention because he is not telling you the prices at the beginning, he says ""yes yes no problem"", and at the end he claims exagerated prices (at least double than normal).  The climax was when I insisted to know the price for horse riding beforehand and he said 80$ for 2h (something absurd!) When I said I don't have so much left, he insisted going to an ATM as if I had to do that horse riding with him. The next day he insisted on giving him all my change because apparently I didn't need it because I was flying back home. He didn't care I had to pay toll road for my car, eat something before my flight, he only wanted more money for him, not caring of his guests needs (and decision).  I was happy to leave and wouldn't return there not even for free. It was the worst experience I had in Egypt. Mohamed is interested only in grabbing as much money as possible from you (at exorbitant prices). My advice is don't go there.â€¦"

Beds were very comfortable. Hot water was always available. Cleaning lady was doing a great job. All staff I met were super friendly and went out of their way to assist.  The location is convenient.

Caroline Crillon Hotel,3.0,,,"49 Syria Street Mohandessin, Cairo 11511 Egypt","This is a 2 Star hotel. Itâ€™s located in Giza which is suppose to be a nice area of Cairo. While the staff are friendly and helpful the place is very noisey, the beds are hard as rocks and the showers donâ€™t have much water pressure and thatâ€™s if you can get hot water at all. I stayed here as a part of a basic tour booking so I suppose I got what I paid for - $46AUD per night. I was here three times throughout the tour and each room had the same issues. It is close to a pharmacy and some local clean restaurants and if you are only staying a night or two it would be ok, any longer and Iâ€™d recommend something a bit better. "

Regency Hotel,2.0,,,"3 Abdel Azim Rashed St., Cairo 11511 Egypt","The Regency Hotel in Cairo is located in the Giza suburb of Dokki a fair walk from downtown Cairo on the west bank of the Nile, aka the crappy side. It is off a busy highway & around the corner from a ladies club. If this doesnt raise your suspicions about this being the wrong Regency Hotel perhaps the hand painted hotel sign will.  Room 506 has seen better days about a decade ago. After enjoying the release of emptying my bowels the toilet wouldnt flush & there wasnt any toilet paper. There was a 28cm tv, mini fridge & aircon. Bedsheets looked sort of gungy & the carpet was fairly dirty. The reception dudes spoke little english but knew how to ask for tips. I played a game of charades with them to try & explain the toilet problem. It was very entertaining, we eventually changed rooms to an equally poor room.  The hotel is housed in the sort of neighbourhood you would go to if you were homeless. Stray dogs & garbage are the main features here if you like to take photos. There are no computers in the hotel, the reception desk used paper & pen! The 80's has come back in fashion here.  The hotel resturant has cobbwebs on the locked door, this is probably not good so avoid even asking for food, just call KFC for takeaway 19019.  The previous review from 2 years ago basically describes our experience word for word, so in 2 years nothing had improved, indeed its pretty shabby. If you stayed here, have a sense of humour & laugh.â€¦"

Your wish is his / their command. Like a real Egyptian genie he will bring you at the most impossible of hours a cool forbidden drink combined with the latest gossip about his vast family. Charming, entertaining, it makes you feel at home. Our room was clean and decorated Egyptian style. The bathroom was the same, however, Egyptian style in case refers to the way it was constructed. It all worked but a sense of humor was needed. In short, a nice, hospitable place with limits for a short stay at the city centre, close to King Tut. Service with a wonderful smile.â€¦"

I also had no problems walking around alone in the neighbourhood. The location is good. There are many restaurants nearby. Itâ€™s very convenient for the old Egyptian museum. The hotel is quite small.   You can book activities through them. The Cairo activities were overpriced but delivered okay services. I booked the Nile dinner cruise in Cairo, a Giza pyramid tour and a 4 day Aswan/Luxor cruise.The guides were not always very thorough and I never knew what was coming next.   DO NOT book Aswan/Luxor activities through them.  I paid almost double what other people on the cruise paid(use visitor it was legit and a good price). My guides were not great and they were frequently trying to scam me. They didnâ€™t provide tour guides at more than 3 temples where I had thought I had paid for them. They didnâ€™t tell me in advance so I wasnâ€™t able to make alternative arrangements.   If you are looking for a cheap, safe, no frills place to hang out in Cairo, then itâ€™s good. If you are looking for a hotel to help you book activities, I would recommend spending the money on a reputable hotel with dedicated staff for tours or finding a tour agency. Other people on my cruise booked it through the boat or website and paid half the price and got twice as much.â€¦"

Our hostess was very humble.  The beverages were fresh squeezed while we ate.  If you have the chance venture to this gem for a meal.
