The pane vino restaurant was delicious and our waiter Adel rahman was helpful, friendly and very efficient.  We found the price is very reasonable and the view was great. This is a must place to eat if you‚Äôre in this area"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Hotel location is good. Walking distance to a couple of tourist spots in downtown Cairo. Breakfast is nice. House keeping guy Taha on 15th floor is very nice and helpful. Good place for long stay. Safe and comfortable.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"GATE 1 arranged this luxurious hotel for our Cairo stay ! It was an amazing experience, very friendly, hospitable , comfortable, efficient! The breakfast was fantastic ; views from rooms of either the Nile or Tahrir square were simply magnificent!  The luggages , check ins, check outs of ALL 57 of us were handled seemlessly by GATE 1 ! The buses were new, with WIFI and charge ports in every seat ! The drivers were  friendly and professional too ..,  THREE CHEERS to GUDES RIHAM, NEHAL and our driver ZACHARIYA! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº  The restaurants were fabulous too , especially the Indian  and Thai ones !"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Great Hotel with Solid Service. Especially the receptionist Yasser helped me and my mom book a reservation at the Revolving Restaurant & we had an amazing date and ambience over there which we really enjoyed.   Highly recommend and especially letting our dear friend Yasser do all the bookings, tours and reservations for you !"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"‚Ä¶.. that there was a time, before retirement, when the Intercon group was my very favourite and I enjoyed their highest status of Royal Ambassador ‚Ä¶ but these days I travel using my own money but still choose this brand when I am able to. The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!  Final Question? ‚Ä¶.. why is the same sandwich served three different ways in three days ‚Ä¶ the F&B director needs to question why standards are not being followed‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed , I and my wife, in Semiramis intercontinental Cairo, for 16 nights from 19/10/2022 to 4/11/2022. It was , as always, a wonderful experience . The reception was very courteous , we were upgraded to a stunning suite, the ladies in the executive lounge looked after us very well. The food was of wonderful variety..this is my 11th year of staying in Semiramis , will never stay anywhere else, in fact we , already, booked our trip for next year. I would like to thank Karim Zereef who helped us enormously, thanks to Mena  in the front desk, the ladies in the lounge, Mena, Hidi, Reem, Nermin . Thanks to Amanny, Waleed, Mehmood, Muhammed, Abu Zaid and the rest. Thanks , once again, to all of you who made our stay so nice and pleasurable‚Ä¶ See you, all, next year!! Najim Ghulam and Hala Safari‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"My wife and I stayed here two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Very good location and attentive staff.  Our room was large, bed very comfortable and we enjoyed sitting on little deck over looking the Nile and the city.  The dinner and breakfast buffet was extensive, food well prepared and there was room for people to move around without banging into each other.  All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The worst reception and service I have ever had in a so-called 5-star hotel. No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I‚Äôve been to over thirty  intercontinentales, and as a royal ambassador I can say this was one of the top one or two. The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.   The ambassador club is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen, out of all the intercontinentales I‚Äôve visited. Only the one in Seoul is of the same caliber.   The location is perfect, right on the Nile and next door to the museum."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Booking and staff are very good and friendly.  THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed for 3 nights here in early November. The hotel was 5 star all the way. The morning breakfast was a spread that can't be matched. So many choices. The room was a good size and was very comfortable. The bed was the perfect firmness. There was a choice of different pillow types. The shower had plenty of hot water and good amenities. It had a rainshower head which we prefer. Our room steward/housekeeper was the same every day. His name was Mohamed Abdelslam and he was awesome! We frequently saw him during the day or evening and he always had a smile, asked us how we were enjoying our stay and if there was anything at all he could get us or do for us. It was a welcome home each day we saw him there. The front desk and concierge were always helpful with directions and answering questions. The location was great for getting around and we always felt safe.. We would highly recommend a stay here and would happily stay here again.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,It is my first visit to the hotel. I like it so mach in general. The hotel is so clean and comfortable and suitable for family. The staff are friendly and kind and corporative. My experience was great specially in area of open buffet in breakfast. There were a variety of dishes that can meet different test . Actually I recommend every one to come there and enjoy it. I gonna to visit it again üëçüèæ

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The room was clean and properly maintained. The staff were pleasant and cordial.  The bar - yes, they sell alcohol - was welcoming.  The food at the morning breakfast buffet was ok but nothing special.  The breakfast dinning room was packed on the three mornings we were there because many tour operators use the hotel, and it was difficult for us to find a table, even at 6:15 am.  The neighborhood was acceptable.  Mike & Bev NYC"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d10356829-Reviews-Steigenberger_Hotel_El_Tahrir-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Ashraf was absolutely the best! He made our dining experience wonderful!

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Kempinski has been my home for a year since I have moved to Cairo for work and I have nothing but great things to say about this exceptional place. What makes it exceptional is their staff, from the reception guys which I will not say all their names but Mohaz, Mohamed are amazing, to their butler service, to Hassan making you feel most welcome to this hotel, to the cleaners And the guys that take care of your comfort. The hotel is small compared to some of the other chains here I. The Nile but, is quiet, clean, well located, and is price friendly compared to the others. The staff at this hotel go out of their way to accommodate our every need ( change rooms, better towels, directions, etc etc) they are impeccable. The amenities at the hotel are simple but on point, the view at the pool amazing, the spa 5 stars, the gym small and practical. I could write forever since I have had the chance to test every aspect of the hotel by living here for a year. On the food side, breakfast is amazing, Mariam greats you and Omar , Hossam and Mina and all others I might not memorize every name make you feel special. Blue is a good tasty Italian place and Osmanly is the best Turkey food you can ask for. Chocolate bar and lounge always good music and amazing deserts ( try the orientam plate)  I have to say thank you for making me feel at home away from home.  Ivan‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We were on a tour of Egypt and stayed at the Kempinski twice--once at the beginning and once at the end.  Both times, we were impressed with the service, the quality of food at breakfast and room service, and the freshly ironed bed linens.  Unfortunately at the end of our trip, we were quarantined for 5 days due to a positive test for Covid.  The staff provided us with everything from food to linens at our request in a timely and polite manner, which helped alleviate the boredom.  The concierge was outstanding.  She was able to find us a doctor to evaluate our ability to travel after 5 days, when no one else could--not our tour company or the American Embassy.  When we left, there were two pre-packaged breakfasts for us to take on our flight.    We definitely would recommend this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"A big thank you for Hady (your French is perfect) and Amir on the reception, guys you are amazing!!

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1597516-Reviews-Kempinski_Nile_Hotel_Garden_City_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Hotel was great, a little tired round the edges but the staff were hugely attentive and professional. Thanks to Mina Girgis for all his help.  The breakfast spread is outstanding, boots were well and truly filled for the day. Location was good for us and despite taking life into our hands somewhat crossing roads, we could walk at night to various restaurants .  One thing, the breakfast manager asked if our servant was doing a good job. Might be worth the Kempinski addressing how they title their staff, having a ‚Äòservant‚Äô didn‚Äôt sit well with us. Our waiter was excellent and polite."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to attend a wedding.  The decor of the hotel is really nice; however, most importantly, the rooms were really dirty. We had a chalet by the pool. The floor of the chalet was dirty, as if you were walking outside. The toilet was terrible, filled with dust and mold.   Housekeeping service is terrible; they didn‚Äôt vacuum the floor; they just made the bed without changing the sheets; and they only provided new towels.   I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel, and I am not coming back."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I have no idea how this hotel got the 5 start designation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶not sure where to start but I will do my best to describe the experience as clear as possible. First of all, this hotel is one of the biggest wedding destination in Cairo which is perfectly alright except that weddings last till 4:30-5am and the music is so loud which means you will only be able to go to sleep then and not before.  Im by no means a litte sleeper. Second, the entire hotel smells like cigarette smoke including my room.  It is an awful smell for a non smoking person. Third, the room feels like it is dirty with carpet stain all over. Fourth, I had no hot water in my First day and when the plumber showed up, he ended up complaining about the unique system in this hotel which is every room has its own water heater‚Ä¶..I had to take a cold shower that day. Fifth, upon check out I called the front office to send over a bell man to help with luggage, that took 45 minutes (literally) I ended up brining down my own luggage so I do not miss my hired ride to the airport. I wish I read a review like this one before I made my plans but oh well, travel and learn‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Excellent place ! The room was clean and quiet. Excelent service .

Gymn is well equipped 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d2389917-Reviews-Al_Masa_Hotel_Nasr_City-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is actually quite lavish from the inside and has a lovely large garden, so ideal for an evening walk in winter. Lovely cafe, small cinema and nice restaurants. The rooms are ok, very standard. Amenities in the room are worn out. The SPA is below average and not enticing at all. The gym is working out and some treadmills don‚Äôt work. On check out they tried to pull a fast one, telling me that I consumed something from the mini bar and I know I didn‚Äôt. They even wanted to show me the wrapper from the garbage. A failed stunt to get money. So watch out."

Tarek our waiter was amazing and the service that was provided; 10/10. Steaks are premium and not to forget about the scenery, it is amazing.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"To start, we scheduled an airport greet and transfer through the hotel.  This was the best thing we ever did.  Ahmed was so professional and helped us speed through the process,  He loaded the private transport car and our driver explained all of the sites to us along the way to the Hotel.  We were greeted immediately upon arrival and check in was a breeze and super fast.  Our room was upgraded for our joint Birthdays and Anniversary and we had rose petals around the room and a big heart on the bed with rose petals.  The most delicious sweets along with a strawberry shortcake was waiting for us in the room.  The hotel is so beautiful and our room has a view of the city and the Nile river.    We could not be more pleased.  What a great experience overall!"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,When you are in Cairo you must come here for an awesome start to the day with a sumptuous spread of breakfast. What made it worth memorable is the excellent service to go with the lovely spread of delicious food. Really loved the service of Asmaa being such a nice hostess and The rest of the team they made our morning extra special
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,I stayed for 2 months and as long as you can afford it I 100% recommend it. The location is perfect. The staff is the best. When you go for breakfast look for Mr Tarek tell him Andre sent you. He will take good care of you. 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We had a confirmed booking but the hotel told us that they had no vacancy when we arrived. The receptionist offered to book another hotel for us of similar quality and price. The second hotel wanted to charge us the same rate as our original choice. Fortunately we checked online and found that the room should only cost half what they quoted. Always check the rate on an independent website  if one hotel refers you to another, while promising similar quality and cost. it could be a scam."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The bests restaurants are here in special the smoke house, the best meat, excellent Service, so kind and nice, very friendly. 100% recommend.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Here at Restaurante Tuscany and enjoying the hospitality (and sampling the great wines) with Tarek!  Great day in the city and a good atmosphere here.   The breads were incredible, the mushroom soup spot on in richness and taste. The sea bream was cooked perfectly and was seasoned nicely by the garnish.  Recommended "
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The Cairo Marriott Hotel is a large hotel with lots of dining options. The rooms are mainly in two large towers, they are a little tired but functional. All they staff we dealt with were excellent. Great choice of outside dining in the evening. Breakfast was a buffet but had a good choice. Overall a great stay, would recommend."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299719-Reviews-Cairo_Marriott_Hotel_Omar_Khayyam_Casino-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Amazing bbq and attentive service...would definitely visit again. I had the beef short ribs and the meat just fell off the bone. The Hasselbeck potato was okay but might needed to be cooked a bit longer.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302323-Reviews-Sonesta_Hotel_Tower_Casino_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Reception and Senior staff  Our group of eleven arrived at the hotel after a late evening flight from Aswan for our three day-stay in Cairo.    The hotel was pre-booked by the Tour Company, but the reception staff were not ready to receive us, and we had to wait for over forty minutes until the rooms were allocated. Then we found that the rooms were not allocated as specifically requested. For example,  two single female guests were given a room with a double bed and a couple were given a room with twin beds! This gave the impression that the Reception staff either did not read the information supplied in advance or if they read them, they did not pay due attention to them.   The Reception staff did not appear to have much hospitality experience. The senior staff were rude, unhelpful, and unfriendly both on the telephone and during face-to-face meetings.    Portage The bell boys or porters were not very helpful, and the guests had to carry their own luggage to the rooms. This was significant given that the group members were senior citizens. This was the first time we had experienced poor service in a ‚Äú5-star‚Äù hotel.   Room Service Room service was prompt, house-keeping staff were very helpful and friendly.    Wi-fi Wi-fi connections and signal were excellent in the rooms and elsewhere in the hotel.   Rooms and bathrooms Rooms were spacious and quiet. However, they were outdated with many defects and shortcomings.   Some of the bathrooms did not have hand towels; some had no bath towels. Although there were tea/coffee making facilities, often there were no cups, teaspoons, tea, or coffee. The air conditioning was switched off and had a very unpleasant smell. In one bathroom, the electric wire in the hairdryer was wrapped in sticking plaster! Bathrooms had mould around the walls and round the bath. The tiles were broken or cracked. A common complaint by all the group members was that the bath handles were coming apart,  and dangerous to hold on to getting in and out of the bath. Door handles were loose and could not be closed securely. Some lights bulbs were not working, and some could not be switched off. These had to be turned off at the socket. Some rooms had not been serviced at all. This gave the impression that the supervisors and the managers had not inspected the rooms.    Restaurant and Meals  The Restaurant area was very small for a hotel with several hundred rooms. There was hardly any room to walk between tables once the diners were seated. Breakfast and dinner menus were basic and not much variety. If you went for a late sitting, food ran short. The Senior Restaurant Manager on duty for one evening was extremely rude and shouted at a guest. We had to report this incident to the Director of the Tour Company to resolve the issues. The restaurant waiters worked very hard but due to a shortage of staff, the service was below expectations.   Cleanliness There were bags of leftover food outside the room in the corridor.   Reporting At the end of our stay, we complained to the Assistant Guest Relations Managers Nermine Wagih and Madonna and provided them with a video and pictures of the state of one of the bathrooms. It was interesting that none of the mangers chose to speak to us and apologised for the poor conditions and service.   Conclusions Based on the above findings, we rate this hotel as 2-star, not 5-star. The contrast was obvious when we compared our experience at other 5-star hotels we stayed in Egypt. The advertised rating of this hotel is very misleading. It is damaging to the Egyptian hospitality industry too.   We have reported the above facts to the Director of the Tour Company we used.   We have made the above observations in good faith with a view to galvanising the hotel management to remedy the shortcomings listed above so that their claim to be a 5-star hotel is well deserved.‚Ä¶"

Front desk assistant manager, Ahmed Sobhy, was super helpful again as he always goes above and beyond to make sure we are enjoying our stay.  The hotel itself is in a good location, rooms are fairly sound proofed and clean. Housekeeping (Mohsen) was super attentive (as always) and quickly replenish whatever they notice you consume the most.  We were always used to staying at Sonesta whenever we travel to Egypt. And I must admit that this time the restaurant didn‚Äôt feel the same without Rosaline (Rose) around. She was always the first to greet us by name and make sure we are enjoying our breakfast to the most. Hopefully, she will be back in the restaurant managing things again soon.   Another drawback is the fact that they allow guests to smoke in non-smoking rooms. So expect to always smell cigarettes during your stay. This will probably never change as this was our 4th time to stay in this hotel, and they don‚Äôt seem to have leveled up to the non smoking policies adopted outside Egypt.‚Ä¶"

He said that we would never be satisfied and to find a different hotel.   Our room when we arrived was in a very unfortunate state. There is black mold growing all around the bath and it has cracked away from the wall. We have not been provided with a bath mat or hand towel since our cleaning yesterday. The toilet roll holder is broken and we were not given more rolls. The electrical plug under the window is dirty and doesn‚Äôt work. Our mini fridge is in a disgusting state and looks to be covered in old rotten food stains.   We were moved to another room on the senator floor and I immediately noticed that room was also a mess. There was dried urine splash on the bathroom floor, green mold growing in the mini fridge and the coffee cups were dirty. It also seems they don‚Äôt vacuum the carpets in between guests.   We were taken to a third room which again had a dirty floor, dirty mini fridge and black mold around the sink. We accompanied the head of housekeeping and the manager to the third room and showed them the mess. The head of housekeeping told me I was mistaken and the marble floor in the bathroom just looked like that. However, when she wet a tissue and wiped the floor, the tissue came away dirty. She then shook the dirty tissue in my face and told me it wasn‚Äôt dirty.   The wifi is very unstable and disconnects constantly. I had to reconnect almost every time I unlock my phone.   The staff here have been quite rude when we have been eating in the restaurants. In the Italian restaurant, I was brought the wrong order and when I asked for it to be corrected, the manager said it was what I had ordered, implying it was my mistake. I specially pointed at the meal I wanted so I don‚Äôt know how this confusion occurred. The correct meal was brought but I was disappointed by the rushed quality of the food.   The next night, we ate in the sushi restaurant and the waiter huffed at my order. He was rude and inattentive. We had to go ask for multiple items. We were one of only two tables in the restaurant so he wasn‚Äôt busy.   We then had lunch in the cafe and after the waiter was rude about my order, he brought the wrong sandwich. The sandwich was taken to be fixed, brought back and again had incorrect ingredients. I had to take the sandwich up to the manager and go over the specifics of what was wrong with the food. It took 55 mins for my sandwich to arrive correctly.   We have had four meals in this hotel and we have had a problem every single time. We are quite unimpressed with the state of this hotel and we would recommend you do not stay here until they fix the attitude problem amongst the staff and clean the rooms better.‚Ä¶"

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

The lobby is beautiful and the property is nicely decorated. Now for the less positive. Although nicely decorated the hallways upstairs are showing  wear with many poorly done patches in the carpets. Our first room. It seemed like there was a bit of cigarette smoke as we first walked in. We started to unpack and the further we went into the room the worse it got. My eyes and nose were burning after only a couple of minutes. We also noticed the refrigerator didn't work when we went to put our water in so it would be cold in the morning. I complained to the desk about the smoke smell and they offered to clean the room. At 10 o'clock at night and a tour at 6AM that was not an option. By the way, cleaning a smoke fouled room is not as simple as wiping things off and changing the linens. It takes a number of hours of an ozone generator running in the room to accomplish the smoke removal. They provided us with another room. It was smoke free, however our clothes and luggage reeked of smoke, the refrigerator in this room didn't work either and the TV got no signal. Our cloths and luggage still smelled after arriving home. The clothes needed to be washed anyway but I had to clean the luggage and run our ozone generator for a few hours to get rid of the smell. This was quite a disappointment for a Radisson and unlike any other we stay in around the world.‚Ä¶"

The Le Meridien Cairo Airport stands out for several reasons.    It is, without question, the most convenient property for those in transit.  The hotel is easily reached via a bridge from terminal three (domestic flights) and, for those arriving internationally in terminal two, access is also a breeze.  Beyond convenience thought are the professional staff that make the property special.  Selma, the guest relations manager went above and beyond to make my stay a pleasant one as did Fady, the night and assistant manager, and Abdelaziz, the front desk supervisor.  All three individuals are assets to this hotel."

There is a walkway to the domestic terminal and a shuttle that can take you to the main international terminal in 5 minutes. Staff were very hospitable and the suite was quite large and comfortable.  Next time we are in Cairo and needing airport accommodation, this will be our choice."

With that said my room was definitely worn and needed an updated / refresh.  While not horrible, for a Le Meridian it was not nearly as nice as the other I have stayed in.  The staff was helpful, the common areas nicely maintained and hotel restaurant options were great.  There was a wedding the day I was there so seems the locals like it enough to host a wedding there so not just people going to / from the airport.  There is a complimentary shuttle bus every 30 minutes to the airport which is actually helpful especially if you are not in Terminal 3.  While you can walk to the other terminals if you have a lot of luggage, etc, the shuttle bus is nice.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d5040629-Reviews-Le_Meridien_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This is indeed a very comfortable hotel for transit passengers. The airport is linked to the hotel via an overhead bridge. They serve breakfast at 4am and you have a generous spread of buffet. Coffee is included so you just need to order with waiters.  As for dinner, the spread is also pretty generous. The only problem I faced is limitations of meat selections because I do not eat beef. Water is only served at 1 glass per person. I am not sure whether the waiter was joking with us or not but he told us it is. We are traveling in a group so we just take from other table.  Swimming pool is good for soaking.   Always check your bills and also ask for the price before ordering. Due to communication problem, you might face some problem during payment."

Conveniently located opposite the airport it is an elegant , modern and very clean hotel  We recommend all restaurants , especially the Lebanese and Chinese , excellent tasty and well prepared . The staff usually is incredibly kind and helpful . The only hassle is communicating with the front desk . One thing you should know , bring tip money in general . It‚Äôs quietly expected. And you should put down a deposit for various treats like restaurant or spa /massage. Egyptians seem to me incredibly afraid of being cheated ,  mistakes cost people‚Äôs jobs apparently. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve been lectured at front desk when I had repeatedly been asked to prepay .  Coming to Egypt  often this is nothing new but in this place a guest should not feel distrustful .  Again it‚Äôs an observation and overall our stay was great before we headed out for another 18 h flight‚Ä¶"

One disappointment was that the coffee bar stopped serving snack meals at 8pm and we didn‚Äôt get in until 9. However, limited sandwiches and amazing cakes were available. Service was a little slow, but always polite and friendly. When we checked out we were swiftly transferred to Terminal 2 by courtesy transport."

Dear Gentlemen or Madam I stayed at your hotel while on a tour with Aventura Tours at the end of October.The first 2 nights I stayed in room 1439. The room was filthy.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   1. The carpet was stained, had something ground into it in areas,¬† discolored and did not appear to have ever been shampooed.2. The phone was sticky to the touch.3.The bathroom had a pubic hair on the back of the toilet. The door heeded some soap and hot water applied to it. The beautiful stone walls did not appear to have ever been washed. I suggest steam cleaning. The second stay in room 2249 was better, but the rug was still very dirty and in need of cleaning. The last evening of my stay I required a wakeup call. I had asked for one but when I thought about it I was uncertain I had given the men at the front desk the correct room number. I went downstairs to ask them to check and they refused to do so. A gentleman from my party tried to help me make them understand that I needed a wakeup call and perhaps they would wake up the wrong person because I had given the wrong room number.I must have spent 15 minutes trying to get it straightened out. Never did.Lasty, the man guarding the breakfast buffet woud not let me go in to get breakfast. I googled the Grand Nile Tower before leaving on the tour. You had a 3. I believe that is generous. You have such great potential to truly be a five star hotel. I hope you make changes or just deep clean the rooms.I can not and would not ever recommend this hotelunti changes are made. ¬†If this is the quality of hotels Aventura books, I need to really investigate accommodations before booking with them again. ThankyouKaren Dedmon ‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308091-Reviews-Grand_Nile_Tower-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The rooms were spacious with a great view over the Nile (I was too low to able to see the pyramids), the standard was so-so, but you could easily tell that this has some age to it. I would not exactly describe this an luxury hotel, but I do think I might have a bit higher standards. The room also had one of my pet peeves, but I was aware of it: carpets on the floor. The room was also seemingly clean, but I could see a few spot on the carpets that in addition to some dorm bunnies. The A/C worked somehow, but it was difficult to adjust the temperature. The TV in the room didn't work, nor did the mini-bar/fridge in the room. The bathroom were also aged, and it was a bit of a hazard to get in and out of the bathtub/shower. The hair dryer worked nicely. I did have some issues the key cards several times, but it was all easily fixed in the reception.   I did not have any problems with the Wi-Fi, it was very easy to use, and I was a bit reassured when I arrived and saw how it was, as I don't really like an open-open Wi-Fi service. But a lot of my colleagues had more troubles with the Wi-Fi, which I found a bit confusing.   I also payed for breakfast included with the room, the breakfast area in the lobby (Fotana Restaurant) had a lovely view, although it was quite noisy due to the layout. There was a great variety of food and drinks, but it was a hassle to ask the waiter/waitress for plain water everytime. The staff quite quick to remove the plates, but in terms of making the table ready for the next guests were so-so. I also observed that the coffee/tea part were changed during my stay, from self-service on a counter, to the waiter walking a trolley around. I also had breakfast down in the food court as I believe the lobby-area was full at certain time. I have the same remarks for there.  I went around the hotel as I had some free time, it was very nice that the hotel offered two ATM (which was particularly lucky for me, as I could get one of them to work for me). Be aware to get money in cash, there's few places that have changes for bills, especially the restaurant, but at least you have the option to pay by card. I was pleased that there were A/Cs throughout the hotel, but I do question how they were operated, as certain days it was so cold that I was actually freezing in the hotel. The swimming pool area was nice with a great view. The terrace floor was also nice, but completely empty of furniture. I checked some of the gifts shops, which were nice and bought some things since it was so easy, but I do think that the person in charge was a bit too pushy with a bit of a communication problem. I did inquire about the airport transportation - which was quite expensive, so I used a third party service which worked nicely. But for the ease of it, I would consider using the hotel's airport transportation if I traveled here again for the convenience.  During our stay I tried two of the restaurant located in the hotel: The Revolving Restaurant and the El Sakya Souk Restaurant with a group of colleagues. We were most satisfied with the Revolving Restaurant in terms of the food, but the services was better in the El Sakya Souk Restaurant. But the view at the Revolving Restaurant is gorgeous, just a shame that about the air pollution, as I believe it could have been even better without the air pollution. I would not recommend trying the pizza at the El Sakya Souk Restaurant. It is also prudent to remember the 12% service charge + taxes, and there's no alcohol, only non-alcoholic options.   It seemed that the hotel did a lot of things, I could observe at least two weddings during my stay, a lot of tourist groups; and there was some loud music happening in the evenings. In additional to our own conference, the facilities for it was satisfying. There's also quite a lot of smokers in this hotel, especially in the lobby, which was a huge cultural shock as this isn't usual for me/us. Grand Nile Tower is a very busy hotel, lucky I could not hear or sense this in my room. The staff were very friendly and polite, but I do think that there were some communications problems/errors. ‚Ä¶"

Unfortunately loud music during the evening. Large and clean room with balcony. The room are a bit worn out. We got a room with a view to the Nile. Beautiful! We arrived late as a group. Despite several calls in advance no keys were prepared for us, so we had to wait a while.  Breakfast the first morning was in the food court. Many guests had to wait for clean cups. The waiter came only with 3 - 4 cups at a time. No cold milk for the cereals. Cutlery were in plastic. Breakfst the second morning were in the lobby and all went fine. When arriving for dinner the first evening our group were refused access to the restaurant. It showed to be a mistake from the hotel. There were only 2 waiters in the restaurant to clean the tables and receive orders for drinks. They did what they could but could not avoid the guests had to wait to be able to order their drinks. It was not possible to get the drinks on the room but we had to pay before leaving the restaurant every day. No alcohol on the hotel!‚Ä¶"

Otherwise it was nothing to write home about.   The room we had had a dead wasp. There was mold in the shower rack. The room we had was so far we had to go outside and into another building.   The check-in was awful too. We were early and even offered to pay extra for early check-in, but they didn‚Äôt allow it until 9am when we arrived at 6am. We were also had our luggage searched because it seems the guy doing the check can‚Äôt tell how a shaver power cord looks like.   The hotel lobby was filled with cigarette smoke too.   Check-out was also painful when we requested for a bellboy to help us transport our luggage. No one picked up the guest service line.   The meals downstairs were also bland and not really good. Although I can give them credit that I did not get sick, which was why I stuck to their buffet offerings instead of eating out and risk getting sick before a long 12 hour flight.   I‚Äôll never recommend this hotel even if you need to be close to the airport. Truly terrible all around experience here and in Egypt.‚Ä¶"

Check-in wasn't great, as commented by other reviews. Worse was the room which smelt like an ashtray - if there were non-smoking rooms we were not asked if we would want these; the room was disgustingly filthy, especially the bath and shower curtain; there was a half eaten muffin on the desk in the bedroom. We only had a 4 hour stay but it was awful, the smoking smell was s strong that I couldn't sleep even though very tired.. Other travellers on my flight who had also been placed in this hotel said their rooms were equally bad (but they didn't have half eaten muffins) and they also didn't sleep.  If you are a non-smoker and are forced to go in this hotel by your airline, ask if they have non-smoker rooms.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Modern hotel near the airport with shuttle - a bit soulless but neat and clean - with nice pool and pretty decent restaurant.  Only issue - which is common in Egypt - is staff expecting you to have exact money. They try to collect city tax in cash but have no change available and get angsty when you have no change either. Novotel - you are the one running a business - how hard is it to keep a drawer of change on hand.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Hi . Check in experience was horrible right from shuttle at the airport to the front desk. . When at the hotel the front desk did not have the courtesy to look after my reservation and they were busy with Egypt airline cancellation bookings ‚Äì they were totally unorganized and ignorant looking after people who came after me. . The agent in front desk did not brief anything about our room had to get information from the   bell boy. That was pathetic and I was served as though its free accommodation given. . Did complained with the duty manager by the name Amir and he was apologetic on the    experience and he assured by on my check out he would have a breakfast box ready since we had to check out time at 4:00 am and I was not surprised even this was not obliged as well. Overall pathetic experience I would not recommend anyone to this property. ‚Ä¶

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I picked this hotel for my one night stopover at Cairo before flying back. As it is right next to the airport with a free shuttle to and from the airport, it was a no-brainer. I also asked them to keep my luggage at the hotel for 3 days before my check-in and they had no issues. It was tagged and kept in the back storage room safe and sound. They also provided me a number to contact the driver when I land, but that number didn't work. Even the hotel number on their business card was not working (saying it is invalid), which was weird. However, after much fiddling I did get a hold of the driver and was able to catch the shuttle from the airport. The shuttle to the airport runs every half hour (at the top of the hour), if there are passengers present, so that wasn't a problem.  The front desk staff was a pain to deal with. Not that they were not friendly, or helpful, but they were slow. If you thought DMV was slow, guess again. Either they were overwhelmed or they were all trainees, but this is the most time I have every spent at a check-in our check-out at any of the hotels I stayed at. The lobby is very nice with a pool in the back, and the night we arrived they even had a live concert (Arabic) happening. Thankfully it finished around midnight else sleeping would've been an issue.  The passageways to the rooms are visibly dated. They felt more like a motel than a Novotel. However, the rooms were clean and all the amenities were there. Our night sleep was much more comfortable than I could've imagined. Also, our room door had a broken deadbolt, so that was something. Food service was sub-par. We ordered dinner around 9 and they gave us stale bread, maybe 2 days old. Even the meats were not fresh. I would advise eating ahead before coming here. Breakfast is a buffet spread and that was good. But we did not have it included so had to pay $10/person. Overall, a good hotel for a quick stopover before catching your flight, but do not plan to stay longer.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"->Area and Surroundings: The hotel is great in terms of location as it is next to the Nile River and connected by two bridges on the either side. One can walk for 5-10 minutes for reaching a general conveno store.   ->Room: I was upgraded to Nile facing room by hotel compliments. The walk to the room was very long, the carpets in the corridor made it difficult to drag the bags, the ceiling height of corridor and room was pretty low.   The room was a normal room, and I did not find it to be too big in room size. All the furniture in the room was decent. The design of the room was pretty old compared to the new modern hotel rooms which are able to take our more space in the same size of the room.  The view from the room was of NILE river and that was one of the consoling factors. At the time of our stay the hotel was undergoing paint work, hence we had to use sheer curtains / blackout curtains for privacy.  The service was very very slow. We asked for water and ice it took them 1 hour to get it, each time we called reception they use to say ‚Äúthe person is on the way‚Äù. They well knew that there were two guests in the room, then also only 01 water bottle was placed on each day instead of entitled two bottles. The reception gave a QR code to contact hotel for services on whtsapp, when I tried, there was no response on the same.  The pillows were extremely not comfortable, when asked to change for feather pillow, thin pillow or orthopedic pillow, the hotel simply denied.  ->Bathroom and Bathing experience: The bathroom was also decent. The setup for shower was like an arrangement which may fall apart at any moment.   ->Hotel Staff: The staff was not upto the mark. We requested the evening staff for preparing our meal boxes as we had a 3:20 AM departure to catch a light. They took our preferences and confirmed. Next day morning what was provided in the breakfast was totally different from what was confirmed.  ->Breakfast: The buffet breakfast was well managed and the spread was good. There were plenty of vegetarian options. The desert / pastry was a miss.  ->Swimming Pool / Gym / Spa: The hotel had a swimming pool like there are few at houses/ appartments. Simply basic  ->Lounge access: I did not have the lounge access.  ->Special mention: Wifi is free, and the speed is not very good. I would suggest a overhaul to the hotel for its floor or reduce charges of the room rate. Its not value for money.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299611-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_Airport-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is an absolute tip and the service from reception staff is appalling.  Stayed here on 2 occasions for 1 night at the start and end of my trip. First night the guy at reception insisted we hadn't paid although we had as it was a business trip. He was rude and kept shuffling the card machine towards me for payment, insisting we couldnt check in until parent was made. His attitude changed when he realised we had someone with us who spoke Arabic, then he was full of smiles and allowed us to check in stating parent had been received, he just couldn't allocate it.  They take scans of your passport and leave people's personal details in full view on the counter  for anyone to see or even take.  The room clearly hadn't been cleaned and I booked a double when I was given 2 singles with an unlocked adjoining door which made me feel on edge the whole night.   The second night I stayed there, I asked the man on reception if he could confirm payment was received on their system and he insisted it had and we could check in (great). The room this time was disgusting. Dirty carpets that hasn't been hoovered, the bathroom was falling apart with paint flaking all around the shower and just overall grim appearance. Two single beds again when a double room was booked and the Aircon was like a jet engine!  Got woken up on several occasions by housekeeping from 7am wanting to clean my room. Their urgency to clean my room was a shock given the general state of it.  Upon checking out my colleagues had no issues until it was my time to check out and again, they insisted I had not paid. I evidenced booking confirmation and they did not want to accept it and again kept pushing the card machine towards me. The staff were rude especially a female member of staff who had appalling attitude. This went on for nearly 30 minutes with the staff instsiting I hadn't paid, getting the general manager to talk to me and state I could not leave until I paid. This was extremely stressful given I had to leave for the airport. After 30 minutes of them being rude and calling me a liar, the general manager said I could go. When I asked if he'd located payment he stated no but I could go and he would chase up with my organisation for payment & this never happened.   Clearly a hotel with staff trying to con people out of more money. DO NOT STAY HERE.‚Ä¶"

Big bedroom, big bathroom. The bed was huge & so comfy. Without doubt it was the comfiest bed I‚Äôve slept in, in the last 12 months. It was like sleeping on a cloud. There was a welcome platter of fruit & pastries waiting for us. The hotel has many restaurants to visit. We are & drank in the English bar downstairs next to the casino & watched the World Cup football matches. Food there was very good.

Hilton Cairo Heli√≥polis surpassed all of these expectations.  As soon as we arrived, we realized that security is a detail that makes all the difference. All cars are inspected and the bags go through a metal detector and x-ray.  When we entered the hotel we understood why all security: surely only the highest authorities stay in this hotel. In fact, more than a hotel, the Hilton Cairo Heliopolis looks like a big conglomerate. During the three nights we were in Cairo, we didn't have to leave the hotel for dinner, because inside the hotel there are Arab, American, Italian, Japanese, Mexican restaurants... and much more...  The leisure area is sensational!! The pools are for all tastes, whether for children or adults. In addition, we realized that the hotel is keen to ensure that we are well taken care of at all times.  The breakfast was amazing, highlighted by chefs Ahmed and Mohamed who were very friendly preparing our fried eggs and omelets. We love the incredible experience provided by Hilton Cairo Heliopolis.  Finally, we are grateful to the helpful hotel concierge team who assisted us with everything we needed, from tours to local activities. On the last day we needed to take the COVID test and the concierge arranged for a doctor to come to our hotel room, making our routine a lot easier.

My wife who is asthmatic, and has cancer, and myself did not get that much sleep. The following day, I complained to the front desk and was transferred to room on the 19th floor which was somewhat better as there was a shower curtain, although the faucet was also leaking.  The breakfast was good though and the Indian restaurant was great!  Other than these positive comments, honestly, this is our worst hotel stay ever.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d300669-Reviews-Ramses_Hilton-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"A heartfelt shoutout to Remonda Adly, Silvia Samir, and Mohamed Taha from the Executive Floors team: thank you again for the great experience, it was very much appreciated!  Location: If you're trying to stay downtown near the Egyptian Museum and Tahrir Square, this is very central. The Egyptian Museum is literally a 3 min walk, and the corniche walkway is right across the street.  Breakfast: Great selection of local and western options. Onsite chef can customize your omelets, as well as other fresh options. Coffee (americano, espresso, cappuccino, etc.) and tea selection is pretty good. They also had 2 onsite options of freshly squeezed orange juice and mango juice while I was there.  View: the Hilton is probably one of the tallest buildings in the vicinity and the top floors give you great sweeping views of downtown, parts of old Cairo, and the Nile. If you have lounge access, you'll have ready refreshments to go with the view, as well as some breakfast options. The room I stayed in was recently renovated, and had all the amenities you would expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel.  Service: this is where the hotel really shined for me. Taken I do have status with the hotel, but I couldn't have asked for anything more. From early check-in to late check-out, everything was very smooth and personable, and all the staff members I encountered were quite helpful. I was also given access to the lounge after my checkout until the next step of my itinerary. Ramses Hilton definitely knows how to take care of its tier members.  Other notes: The gym was a little bit on the smaller end, but had everything I needed. The elevators are a little outdated and could be a bit slow, especially if you're heading to the top floors, but personally I didn't mind: these are all small prices to pay for all the other benefits. Definitely a 5/5 in my book :)  I look forward to coming back soon.‚Ä¶"

Dahab hostel provides a wonderful breakfast every morning for a very affordable price; the perfect way to start your day. The bathroom facilities were very clean and the staff was very attentive.

Salama was very helpful when assisting me with my train booking to Alexandria. He was also very kind when asking about my plans and giving me local knowledge of the different parts of Cairo. Ahmed checked me in on several occasions and always enquired as to how I was doing and gave me some sterling safety advice when taking public transport. The lady who made me breakfast every morning 'Ohmmaqmood' I think her name was, accommodated my nutrition requirements without question.   Overall if you are visiting as a solo traveller or a couple, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. The service is second to none! "

Housekeeping staff were very attentive to any needs or requirements for our room, always with a smile. The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of choice of both hot and cold food. Omelettes etc. were also made to order. The rooftop restaurant was a nice place to chill with great views over Cairo.

There is absolutely nothing the hotel can do about this . But if I knew about the noise I would I stay at another hotel . The music is so loud you can‚Äôt hear the TV   The hotel is ok . Basic and clean .  The rooftop bar does not serve alcohol .  We don‚Äôt eat or use the facilities.  Although well located I would not recommend this hotel based on the noise .

For a 5 star hotel it was a terrible stay.  I stayed for 3 nights on both sides of the hotel. Either side you stay it was extremely loud and could not sleep. It sounded as if the there were no windows or the windows were open. ABSOLUTELY NO SOUNDPROOFING. Nile side had party boats and nightclub playing extremely loud music directly across from the hotel till 3am and the other side had the opera house which also played very loud music till late at night. I could hear absolutely everything from extremely loud music, constant beeping on the streets and call for prayer music. After reading the reviews from others it appears they always reply with customer care is a priority however all the rooms are renovated but the issue of soundproofing was completely discarded. Complete disregard for customer comfort. Also wifi within the hotel unusable. Don‚Äôt even bother with wifi. I don‚Äôt often write reviews but for this hotel I felt it is required so no one else experiences what I did. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME AT THIS HOTEL!!!!‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1200790-Reviews-Novotel_Cairo_El_Borg-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Offered an upgrade to Nile facing suite and whilst appreciated I suspect the rooms on the Nike side are often vacated for quieter rooms on the other side of the hotel. Party boat music starts in the late afternoon and finishes after 2am. Loud irregular drumming and some amateur sounding singing does grate on the nerves. Turning the fan up full on your rooms AC does help to drown out the noise slightly but occasionally there was a live female singer whose voice could shatter the hotels windows. If you wear hearing aids or sleep with noise cancelling headphones then you‚Äôll be okay. The actual room and the view over the Nile was very nice so hopefully the Novotel has plans to add some social glazing in their windows for the party boat noise. Pool was small, some reception staff had difficulty with English and ambiance of hotel seemed more for Egyptian business people.   For cheap water and snacks: exit the hotel facing the Nile. Turn to your right and walk down the first street to your right ( you dont have to cross the road). A very honest man that does not export tourists owns a small minimart. Small water 4LE, Small Sprite 5LE, Small Dorito chips 6LE.‚Ä¶"

What could be a very nice hotel,let down by complete neglect.  Internet completely unworkable.  You may be able to log on occasionally, but it is unusable.  They say you can go to the lobby and use and fob you off with stories about passing complaints to IT manager.  People are not going to Egypt to surf internet, but in todays connected world where everything is done online this is really too much.  Want to check your flight details? Bad luck, head to the lobby.  Want to talk with family and friends back home, bad luck.  Want to order an under eats or car to go to the airport, your outa luck.  Want to keep kids entertained with YouTube after a long day touring? You guessed it.   Room service food I found terrible, but kids liked it.  If you have taste of eight year old child then I guess this is good enough for you.  Rooms in bad need of refurbishment, but the beds are genuinely comfortable.  Staff are nice and friendly, trying to help where they can.  There is a fun fair and disco river boats stationed directly across from the hotel.  The noise is extremely loud.  Kids talked me into taking them down and we had a good time.  If you are thinking of sleeping anytime before late/early morning than think again.  Avoid at all costs using the tour service in the hotel lobby.  After confirming the tour with them and all costs involved they immediately started asking for extra money for entry fees, extra money for car entry, insisting that they pay for entry tickets etc etc.  They immediately stoped at a papyrus ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù for high pressure sales, and when at the pyramids then dump you with aggressive camel touts and insist that the tour you paid for is only a taxi fee to drive you back and forward from the hotel. Only the threat of getting police involved  as the camel tout was leaning in the car screaming at me and my 8 year old daughter who was shaking in fear when we refused to pay hundreds of dollars for additional add ons to the ‚Äútour‚Äù got them to leave.  In short do not have anything to do with this hotels tour services.  A complete disgrace and an embarrassment for the Novotel hotel range to be associated with.‚Ä¶"

It's a little far from the main attractions in Cairo, but definitely it's a great place to stay and relax away from all the noise from the city. Again... Definitely recommended 100%  Their  entire staff from the reception at your arrival all the way to you departure  and everything in between.

Sara was so professional that she managed to make me willingly stay at a hotel that is almost 1.5K more than my initial budget :) (and I type this with a huge smile on my face)   We arrived at the reception, staff were amazing and friendly, especially Menna and Maryan (I think) Menna knows who I‚Äôm talking about. Please refer to her.   We were guided to our STUNNING room. Then we went to the pool- a huge thank you to Hany at the pool who was very supportive, friendly and had a huge smile on his face- very welcoming and attentive as well. I want to thank Hany for being dedicated and focused, I forgot my expensive tanning oil and when we went to the pool the next day he had kept it for me in lost and found which I really appreciated.   I also want to thank Dyana at the pool bar, she does the best lemon mint smoothies, she‚Äôs always smiling and pleasant to talk to. She focuses on details mentioned and doesn‚Äôt forget what was requested. She‚Äôs very professional as well and is keen to be a great representative to the hotel.   Food Quality Review: - breakfast buffet: was good, diverse and clean.  - pool bar: drinks we ordered were lemon smoothies and chocolate milkshake, clean, fresh and refreshing, we ordered a pizza on the pool it was also good. Nothing fancy, just a usual pool side pizza which we enjoyed.  - room service (or private dining as they call it): they made us an amazing cake for my daughter, fruits are fresh and clean, bakery is amazing at this hotel, my daughter had a which sauce pasta with chicken which she enjoyed, I had ordered the cold m√©zza platter, it needs to be revisited and I had shared my feedback with Mr Alaa the head of the Room service department and he was keen to know my feedback for improvement which Im sure he would work on as he seems like a professional and experienced Manager.   Housekeeping; When we arrived the room was amazingly clean, spotless and was well decorated for my request. Thanks to the team. My only comment is that the following morning I had the sign on for the room to be cleaned from 7:00 am until 12:30 and when we came back to the room it wasn‚Äôt cleaned. I would highly request for the housekeeping team to keep a close eye on such small details as they‚Äôre doing an amazing  job keeping the entire hotel clean.   Overall rating is a 8.5 and I would definitely go back again for a vacation!‚Ä¶"

From the outside, the hotel looks new and luxurious, as well as in the common areas of the hotel. However, the rooms are small, the beds are uncomfortable, the windows do not close completely. The rooms need updating, you can see that they are old. There were 3 people in the room, we only got 2 sets of towels. The staff took our luggage to the room (not asked for it) and insistently demanded a tip for it. In general, the service is very imposing when it comes to luggage, even when you say that you can handle it yourself, they snatch it from your hands (of course they want a tip later). If you want to sleep, you won't be able to either. The hotel plays very loud music and there are live shows until 00:00. It's unacceptable for it to be loud for so long. In addition, at 04:00 someone was making a fuss in the next room and the phone to call the reception did not work. Breakfast decent but we never got the tea we asked for. This is one of our worst hotel experiences. The only plus is the free shuttle to the airport.‚Ä¶"

The 1st room we had the bath tub wall fell in and cause major flooding so we moved to a new room.  2nd room: Still very old and smelled like smoke. Must be from 1970s cigarettes.

The penne ariabata was amazing from the Italian restaurant. The waiter was kind enough to make us a non alcoholic mohito. Tje chef at breakfast was very good too interactive and no request was ignored.   I was traveling with young children ranging from 2 - 8year old and 2 other adults. We had connecting family room with a cot bed. Room service always cleaned rooms. The bathroom could do with some renovating but overall it was OK. The balcony had a nice view facing the swimming pool. The swimming pool was warm however kids pool was cold! There was a play area for kids, which was constantly being cleaned and it was great fun entertainment. They had a big screen outside but not anything decent to watch. It would be nice if they had movies playing give it an outside cinema feel.  They did have weddings there in the outside area and the music was a little bit loud but to be honest we really enjoyed it. The music kept going until after midnight.   We booked most of our activities through the hotel and our driver Mohammed was amazing. He made us feel safe and made sure we had an excellent time. The hotel should be very proud to have him. The manger of the activities (didn't catch his name) was the complete opposite. He made inappropriate comments towards us which made us uncomfortable. The other thing that really was not nice was the constant bugging from porters asking us where we had been and how much we paid for the activities!!! We did bring this to the hotels attention in the end. I understand why they would ask in the reception and write the info down but the porters were riding up elevators with us to ask!!!! This should be prohibited as it becomes very awkward.   Overall stay could've been 10/10 easily if the few things could be improved. Great stay for families with young children.‚Ä¶"

When I did get changed the next evening, the private bathroom was actually across the hall, accessible by key and super inconvenient. The rooms themselves are huge, but have no personality or character, just all white walls, white bedding, bright overhead lights. Staff were friendly enough until they realised I didn't want to book any tours or private drivers with them, then they lost interest. It's a budget hotel, so I didn't expect the Ritz, but there are better out there.

Breakfast was ok. Staff was good & friendly. Definitely if they consider minor details in cleanliness & improve it, it‚Äôll be very great."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d614748-Reviews-Osiris_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel was nice, the location is perfect and the team very friendly. Unforutnately, it's very loud, the walls are paper. The stay could be improved by vaccuiming the floor a bit more, having a lamp next to the bed and a bit better breakfest. As european, it was really not for our taste. Otherwise, the stay was really good and I would recommend this hotel."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d614748-Reviews-Osiris_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,We first arrived and it took about 40 minutes to go up the elevator - the hotel shares the elevator with other commercial offices.  The hotel wanted to charge $30 for a cab when Uber was charging $6.  The beer was $10.  The breakfast food is terrible - flies everywhere. Our room was not very clean - the water stopped working for an entire day - had to brush with bottled water and not shower.  The staff was bunch of greedy men who just want to make money of you.  NOT SURE HOW THIS HAS A TRIP ADVISOR SEAL - THEY MUST FORCE THE GUESTS TO WRITE REVIEWS FOR THEM.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d614748-Reviews-Osiris_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"When we arrived there had been a mix up with our booking. Kareem quickly sorted it out and gave us a very spacious room with a small balcony. The air conditioning worked well, as did the WiFi  and there was plenty of hot water. I had some washing that needed doing and they were very happy to do thisThe roof top bar, where breakfast is also served,  is quirky and a good place to wind down after a day of sightseeing. Breakfast does not start until 8, or even a bit after which was rather late if you are trying to get out early to beat the heat. However, there was plenty of selection, including some very nice falafel, Carlos did an excellent job. Overall, for a two star hotel, and considering the price we paid, it was very impressive, especially the friendly staff."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d614748-Reviews-Osiris_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,I couldn't believe the price of this hotel which included breakfast for 2 people. Wasn't sure hoe it would work out but decided to give it a try. The taxi driver that took us there from the airport was uncertain if we were in the right place but I recognized it from photos that I had seen online. It is a very basic hotel but was clean and tidy and we found the location pretty good. The hotel is on the 12th floor and there is an elevator to take you up. The lentil soup that they serve in the restaurant is very good.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d614748-Reviews-Osiris_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Really amazing hotel , with a well trained staff.  Totally recommend for everyone . Food and buffet were excellent and have several types of food . Special thanks for Mr Mohamed Fateh el Bab events manager he was very cooperative person"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d614748-Reviews-Osiris_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I'll give you the positives first. The place is clean, has a pleasant lobby with a reading room on the side. The restaurant on the top floor is good; this is important because the restaurant choices in the neighbourhood are limited. I had laundry done, and they did a good job for a low price. As for location, it's within walking distance of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities and Tahrir Square. The staff is mostly very helpful, BUT... anybody who has traveled in Egypt knows that the quality of customer service varies greatly. In my case, when I was checking out, the woman at the desk told me I had to pay cash. I said, OK, no problem, where's the nearest bank machine? She said, ""banks are closed on Sunday."" That, of course, was a ridiculous response. Fortunately, another employee within earshot said that there was an ATM around the corner. Turned out that he was wrong, too. There are actually two ATM's a half block down the street. So no problem, but you really have to wonder, how can somebody work in a place and not be aware of where the nearest ATM is? It's important to know that the reception desk is actually on the tenth floor. This isn't an issue during the daytime, because there's a desk at the building entrance. However, if you arrive at 3:30 AM like I did, that desk will be unmanned. I had to bang on the elevator door for a while before the front desk guy became aware of my presence. The staff should really advise people of this when they book for late arrival. Finally, most taxi drivers don't know where the Osiris is. This is no surprise, because most Cairo taxi drivers don't know where anything else is, either. But be sure to have the hotel's business card with you to show the driver, and have the hotel's location on the GPS app on your cell phone.‚Ä¶"

The staff was considerate, helpful, flexible, and exceptionally kind. Whatever I needed, they were incredibly helpful and very welcoming. They were never pushy! While everyone there was wonderful, I'd like to especially thank Carlos, Abed, and Mina for making my stay wonderful. (Oh, and their English was excellent.) The location was great - right in the center of everything yet quiet. The breakfast (included) was very good, as was the dinner, all on the rooftop with a great view of the city. The staff at Osiris really made my vacation great. Highly recommended."

The cleaners come and clean your room on a daily basis is you wish.  The wifi is great too.  The location is excellent as it is down town and right by Tahrir Square so close to the Egyptian Museum and the underground so very quick and easy to get to Giza.  There is also a great caf√© close by down the street on the way to Tahrir."

Five minutes after we got in the room we walked out. The bottom of the bathtub was dark gray from dirt. The chair was very much worn out, and there was disgusting stain on the bad sheet. We showed it to the receptionist and he told the owner or manager. They told us, he was the owner. We told them that we are leaving and asked if they were willing to refund our money. We were told yes but only thru agoda. However I could not cancel it thru agoda because it was after check in date. I sent e mail to agoda but no response and I could not find a phone number for them.

The tours they arranged for me where excellent (Giza pyramids, Old Cairo, Alexandria and with the current pandemic situations they provided PCR test convenience and right on time results). The prices were all reasonable for a budget minded traveler like me. The most important thing too was time-management to see everything according to my plans.

It is totally dirty. We are a party of four, but when we arrived, we were given a room with three beds. They told us that the following day they would give us a room for four. That never happened! Then, when we got into the room, we discovered that there was hot water but the shower didn't work. There was neither toilet paper nor soap and just one towel four us all. A hairdryer? Impossible!! Two days after our arrival, we had a plumber working in our room for more than an hour till he could fix the shower. We didn't have WIFI in the room, only in the common areas. It seems that it is a building where people rent rooms permanently as we never met other tourists. The worst of all was that men were all day smoking in the common areas. The supposed ""hotel"" is on the 5th floor, but to use the lift you need someone from there to activate it with a card, so we had to go up and down the stairs a great many times. We went to Luxor for two days, and when we came back, we were given the same room, but this time there was no hot water. Please NEVER EVER RESERVE THIS NASTY PLACE!!‚Ä¶"

The hotel also arranges Cairo tours mainly by Mr Ahmad Faris but if one takes your from hotel please bargain prices and first let the person know which places they would cover with entry fees. Sometimes they will say with entry but when you go they tell that some entries not covered under tour. If you take Alexandria tour must go inside Alexandria library because the tour permits visit to library from outside but one should definitely go inside this huge library and insist that the tour covers it's entry.

The room and furnishings were dated, the bathroom floor leaked water daily, the hot water ran out after 2 showers. The tap had 2 positions, over the sink and barely over the sink and shampoo was not enough for 4, given in small packets. The safe didn‚Äôt work so taping the batteries in became the answer by the staff, who although kind, really haven‚Äôt fixed any of the problems mentioned in reviews on this or other booking sites. Nonetheless, the taped batteries fell out and we had to call staff again.  The air conditioner was filthy and the window above the lower window didn‚Äôt close so all the noise came in. Breakfast was a measly smorgasbord of bread, boiled eggs and tea or coffee, the same daily.  Pickup from the airport is free if staying more than 2 nights. The no seatbelt dirty car will not necessarily fit all your luggage, we struggled with 4 suitcases. Return journey is US$15 again in a non seatbelt, not hotel run car.

He organised all the personalised tours..with exclusive guide..Food ,tho not of wide range, was good enough..& the elderly Chef was always obliging...Airport pick up was free; drop off, @USD15 was also ok...Overall, had a very pleasant experience of Cairo sojourn, with City View as base."

Located in Zamalek Cairo, this hotel is ok situated, about 1hr or so from airport.   Local area is good for restaurants, banks, pharmacies, and grocery store.   The foyer is not bad.  There is a restaurant on top floor, they have decent food, but very slow service.   The bar at ground level is dodgy, I ordered beer paid and the barman kept an extra 100LE.  I was adamant I paid correct amount and was expecting my money back, he denied I gave extra.  After he pulled money out of his pocket it was determined he owed me the 100LE, will not go there again.     The first room I had was a twin bed street facing.  Ok room, working AC, and bathroom ok.  Very noisy from street as no seals on windows, lots of honking.   Another room later, was river facing, and more upscale, but had smell of smoke.   All in all I had ok sleep, via putting in ear plugs. Elevators are tiny.   Breakfast is on mezz level, they have buffet and ok service.  Does trick to get going for day.     This place is not luxury, but is average, not bad for starting out in Cairo.‚Ä¶"

Classic interior, huge & clean rooms and cozy bar at ground floor. Amazing views to the Nile. It misses a gym, but there are a couple of choices walking distance. It's a legendary place with tons of day and night leisure destinations nearby.  In short, it‚Äôs a great hotel, in a great location with excellent value for money.  PS. Don‚Äôt miss out on the breakfast."

It is near the Nile River but located very noisy place. You can hardly open your window. Air Conditioner was extremly noisy you can sleep. Two other guests with us also said this. The brealfast is poor and tasteless. I have to say that staff was nice and helpful. Keep away from this hotel.

The room itself was smart, bed comfy and bathroom was good size with a bath.   Hotel location is also great situated in a safe/good neighbourhood so your stay should be trouble free.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I am sharing my experience so any future guests will be aware when booking at Tolip Golden Plaza. I stayed twice in less than a month, and the same issues were never fixed, and more rising issues justify the decline in their rating score. They are far from hospitality, lack experience, have low self-esteem at the front desk personnel, and have bad management. I stayed on 10/27/22 in room#10 by the pool. The reservation was made over the phone, we got there a little after 11 pm the check-in with the front desk guy named Ahmed was the longest check-in I have ever experienced. As I was at the front desk for the longest time guests who checked in before me were all coming to the front desk to address their issue with their room key card that wasn‚Äôt working some of them were very frustrated about going back and forth to the front desk for 2 or 3 times. Finally, he checked me in after almost 50 mins and warned me that my room key card might not work because they were having an issue with the key card programming machine and no IT person on duty in the morning it should be fixed but to let them know if I had any issues with it. Unfortunately walked to the pool area and got to my room and the key card didn‚Äôt work had to walk back and they kept me waiting for another 15 mins till Ahmed and another guy walked with me back to my room and kept trying the spare which also gave them hard time and after a while, it opened and they told us that most likely you will have the same issue if you leave again tonight and come back so they advise us to use the sliding doors for the balcony to exit and when we come back. The sliding doors weren‚Äôt even locking so anyone really can walk into your room. The bed closer to the closet was sliding on the room floor tile because the bed legs weren‚Äôt locking. The balcony is overseeing the pool area but the room door is overseeing the tennis court which they allow guests to use late after midnight and it gets pretty loud. The next morning went to sit on the balcony and found the plastic chairs have sticky stains on them and lots of ants. Called room service 4 times to get someone to iron my shirt because no iron in the room. Forgot sweatpants (Nautica navy blue) in the bathroom and when called they said they will check and get back to me no one did. I am a strong believer in second chances so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt I booked again on 11/18/22, I tried to book it over the phone but they said no rooms were available but online is showing that you do have availability so they asked me to book online on a 3rd party website. I originally booked a single room but later my dad decided to join me on the trip so I called them to change to a double room they said I can only do that when I check in but I was afraid they will be sold out so I asked the guy on the phone to put a note on my reservation to transfer to a double room which he said he did and told me it will $20 extra. I went to check in and it was the same front desk guy Ahmed from before. He asked us to be seated for 5 mins till he finishes the group check-in, we waited for 30 mins, and he also started helping other people who just came so I got up and got in the line too. The line wasn‚Äôt moving at all and another front desk was available so I asked him to check me in, his name was Omar he couldn‚Äôt locate my reservation I showed him the confirmation he called someone else who wasn‚Äôt wearing the same uniform looks like he already finished his shift. He wasn‚Äôt too happy he went to the back office and Omar asked me again to be seated for 5 mins I replied I already sat down for 30 mins and I have my dad who is 76 years old and I need to get him to the room, he told me I promise it will be 5 mins. Then he called me in and said that we don‚Äôt have any double rooms and that my booking was for a single room. I had to explain to him that I spoke to someone on the phone to upgrade and they suppose to be left a note on the account so he said let me see what I can do, then he was trying to use the staple but it was out and he said ‚Äúwhat an awful night‚Äù in his language (heya Leila Zarka) kept going back and forth for a staple then sat down the paper on the counter went to the back office again then came back saying it‚Äôs my lucky night we found you a double room. It was room 737, asked me for the $20 gave him the card, but the credit card terminal is out then asked if I have cash. He unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked. I asked to have 3 key cards since we are 2 in the room and he said only 1. Finally checked in, five mins being in the room phone is ringing Nourhan from guest relations asked if everything was okay and I addressed the inconvenience of a lengthy check-in time that goes for almost an hr that I never experienced anywhere else, she said she will let the manager know and went out an hour later with my dad when we came back we noticed the bed closer to the window is caved in so I let my dad sleep on the other bed. I woke up at 4 am to use the bathroom and my back is sore from the metal springs in the mattress I had to fold my bedspread in 4 to make up enough layers to fill in the mattress bow. The next morning I left the key on the counter at the front desk and walked away but the guy was trying to ask me to wait while finishing another guest, I told him I don‚Äôt need a receipt. This place isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be and is managed by a bunch of inexperienced people who knew nothing about the hospitality business.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,We stayed 4 nights during a tour in Egypt and the hotel didn't disappoint us. The twin room was very comfortable and spacious with a view over the city.   The breakfast buffet was AMAZING! A huge spread. Loved the fava bean porridge and accompaniments and falafel!    There is a huge shopping mall 10min walk from the hotel.  I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to have a comfortable stay in Cairo.

A call for slipper responded in 2 hours.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"My family of six children, ny wife and myself arrived for the first time in Egypt and were looking forward to a pleasant stay at the five star hotel- Tolip golden plaza hotel  On our arrival we were told that we did not have a booking which was untrue and then we were told that our booking was for one room and not three . We got that sorted out ,which took some time , and they found our booking but then we found out that the rooms were all smoking  rooms. This was despite making sure we requested  three NON SMOKING rooms on our o line booking. On entering the rooms,  two of them were absolutely  disgusting . The stench of cigarette smoke was foul and overpowering  and my daughter, who suffers from allergies and has sensitive skin, was finding it hard to cope. We are not unreasonable and one room was adequate so we left our sons in there. When we spoke to the reception,  we were told that they would find us other rooms.  We said as long as two rooms were on the same floor that was fine so our daughters could be with us. They told us that that two rooms on the same floor were available. They gave us only one room .   My wife and myself took that upper floor and my daughters were waiting in the smoking room as we had been told they would be moved imminently.   They sat in their travelling clothes without relaxing waiting with their suitcases.   I then went down to sort it out.  At reception i was met with hostile and unhelpful staff members who avoided eye contact with me . Again i was assured someone was going to come and the new room was being prepared.  We were assured that it would be ready promptly within the hour .   An hour passed with nobody dealing with our issue. On phoning down to reception and asking again we were told five minutes and that passed too.   We phoned again and kept on hold until they said someone was coming.   Someone from housekeeping did indeed come then and took my daughters to a room which was ANOTHER smoking room and not only that but was the room that my wife and I had vacated!    Another call to reception and we were told someone was dealing with it and to be patient .  Another hour passed and then another Finally i fell asleep  with my wife and daughters still waiting for a room.   Imagine how tired we all were and how exhasted .   Finally at around 2 in the morning my wife had had enough and went down to reception almost in tears, fatigued and angry. There- one member who had just come on shift  finally gave her a clean non smoking room  but on another floor -with assurances that the following day we would be given another room hopefully on our floor once people had checked out.   Imagine our  surprise when we did not get that room and no one even asked us about it!  We gave up at that point and couldn‚Äôt wait to leave the place.   Three rooms on three different floors. I wasn‚Äôt able to keep an eye on my young children and my daughters . It is totally unacceptable and so unbecoming to a hotel that boasts five stars.   Cleaning staff and housekeeping were more friendly and helpful than front desk. They were the rudest and most unhelpful people I could have hoped to meet and for staff who were supposed to deal with clients in the hospitality business they were totally unsuited to their profession. I never want to go to that hotel again - the experience was terrible and gave such  a bad impression of Egypt. As a frequent flyer I have been around the world and it is not an exaggeration to say that this hotels front desk staff was the worst I have experienced in any of the countries I have been in terms of attitude and behaviour . Perhaps some retraining in the art of hospitality might be in order .‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12901747-Reviews-Tolip_Golden_Plaza_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The place is difficult to reach. The entrance is obscure.  The reception is chaotic. Personnel are evasive and generally unhelpful. The staff are just too stiff! Toilets are sub-optimal regarding cleanliness. The meeting room and the parking are OK. The price is not cheap either.  Generally would not recommend except as a last resort.

At check in, we were told that the booking was for only 1 double and 1 single and that I had to pay for the child. We were not agreeable and contacted Agoda which sorted it out. Breakfast was good and filling. There are lots of restaurants nearby to eat. We didn't use any of the facilities."

The hotel lobby, coffee shop, outdoor pool and location were great. The morning buffet breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly and helpful.  However, the rooms are extremely old and dated. Additionally, they have not been maintained. On the first night, water from the bathroom above our room leaked and flooded our bathroom. The room balcony which had a fantastic view of the Nile was unusable as it hadn't been maintained and dirty.  I would still stay at this hotel due to the location, amenities and staff."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301697-Reviews-Hilton_Cairo_Zamalek_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I think this Hilton is the best one in Cairo at the moment. They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶. I can recommend this hotel fully and can‚Äôt wait to return here.‚Ä¶"

At the same time the access to places of interest is very convenient. The hotel by itself is very well managed with competent and friendly service. Overall a very good choice for staying in Cairo and would be staying in the same hotel anytime we visit Cairo again.

He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!  Final Question? ‚Ä¶.. why is the same sandwich served three different ways in three days ‚Ä¶ the F&B director needs to question why standards are not being followed‚Ä¶"

Very good location and attentive staff.  Our room was large, bed very comfortable and we enjoyed sitting on little deck over looking the Nile and the city.  The dinner and breakfast buffet was extensive, food well prepared and there was room for people to move around without banging into each other.  All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The worst reception and service I have ever had in a so-called 5-star hotel. No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.   The ambassador club is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen, out of all the intercontinentales I‚Äôve visited. Only the one in Seoul is of the same caliber.   The location is perfect, right on the Nile and next door to the museum."

THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "

They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶. I can recommend this hotel fully and can‚Äôt wait to return here.‚Ä¶"

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

Shady and Muhammad Abdullah at the front desk remember you and your room number throughout the stay. Very helpful. Rehab and Nagwa run the restaurant with caring and efficiency. Suites are as big as my first condo. Two caveats: 1, there is no pool. You can walk through the lovely Intercontinental pool area (sister hotel next door) but you can‚Äôt use it. 2, no dedicated tour desk. The front desk staff will help arrange anything you request, though!    The hotel is connected to an upscale mall with gourmet grocery store, theaters, and tons of restaurants."

When we spoke to the staff/management they had claimed it was an issue with the main water supply of the area and not the hotels issue. We called a bunch of times to see if this was resolved and got no proper update.  We left the hotel to go out and before coming back we called in the afternoon to get an update and the status was that the water issue was not yet resolved and nobody went to clean the room yet. In the evening around 10:30 we called again and the hotel staff assured us the room was checked and cleaned and the water issue was resolved.   We got back to the hotel and went back to our suite, the whole apartment had water soaked into the fitted carpet. When we went down to speak to the  management they said they would change our suite for us which they did but  ended up being in an apartment suite  that was in worse condition in terms of cleanliness than the first one we stayed in!   There was dust everywhere the room looked like it was not used in a long time. There was dust on the toilet area, there was dirt and crumbs on the carpet, dust on shelves, the bedding in all three rooms had dust and hair on them. According to the staff the suite had been ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù earlier in the day. We were surprised by how confident they were in claiming everything had been cleaned when clearly it was not!    It is now 1:30am and the staff are cleaning under our supervision! We are supposed to be on a relaxing holiday and instead this trip has been full of stress and irritation due to negligence by hotel staff and management. Their compensation to us was slippers and tissue boxes!!!   The attached photos speak for themselves even the hotel staff who came to move our luggage to the ‚Äúnewly prepared suite‚Äù were embarrassed to see such a dirty and disgusting apartment suite. All they could say is on ‚Äúbehalf of the hotel we are truly sorry tell us what we can do to make it better‚Äù.   Seriously???!!!!!!  This is supposed to be under ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù hotel chains and it was no where near the Hilton standard!  We are extremely shocked and frustrated and disappointed about everything we have been through and still have to stay until our. Checkout as  it is non refundable.‚Ä¶"

It was a - 0000. The hotel pictures were falsely depicted online. I DO NOT recommend any international travelers to stay at this hotel. I PROMISE you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it certainly does not meet Covid protocol. It was unsanitary and management  and overall customer service was the WORST. We rented a suite to accommodate my family. We checked in at 4am in the morning and the complaints began as soon as we walked in. We ended our stay there by 11am. Total of 6 hours of disgust and poor hospitality. My cousin was locked into one of the bedrooms and we had to call the front desk from our cell phones since our hotel room phone was not working. It took them an hour to break down the door and get him out. The couches and dinning room chairs were stained, the carpet was stained and had lifted from the floor. The kitchen was not cleaned the stove had not been cleaned from the previous stay and was rusted and old. A loud electrical noise was coming from the kitchen that they couldn‚Äôt resolve and it lasted the entire time. The bathrooms were SCUM. Not cleaned. Toilets were stained and we could see scum and mold forming in all three bathrooms. No toilet paper, no clean towels, no soap‚Ä¶. Complete mess. I had initially reserved 3 nights and that quickly changed to a few hours. The manger that was the least bit helpful. I kept talking to her in English and she would respond in Arabic. She said she would not give us a refund that we would need to call Hilton hotline to complain. Although Hilton had said that the hotel would need to directly refund me. The hotel mgr mentioned they will be closing their doors anyways for remodeling in the next coming months. And she also said that since I spent more than a few hours in the hotel that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them to refund me. RIDICULOUS. This hotel needs to be reported to the Tourism Authorities really. Egypt is a beautiful and wonderful country full of hospitality and history and the people are full of heart and kindness. The hotel and management did not represent this country in any form or way. Shame on your Hilton World Trade.‚Ä¶"

Good to stay.  The hotel is far from the city center, do shopping is not easy.  The travel services to visit tourist spots provided by the Taxi booth of the hotel (named Last Minute travel services) was not up to the mark. The driver dropped me on the Egyptian museum and he was supposed to stay  at the gate. But when I come back visiting the museum, I did not find him. Then I called him and he declined the call. I sent him message , he responded sending message after half an hour without giving any specific time of coming. I was puzzled, waiting and waiting. Then I was thinking to hire another Taxi. Finally he came after more than an hour.   The services provided was also costly. I could hire a Taxi using the APP less than half price.  On the way back, it was planned to take me a super store for buying dry fruits. But  he did not took me to a right store. It was felt to me that he did it intentionally.‚Ä¶"

Restaurants - Middle eastern restaurant on the BR level was excellent - we had chicken soup, pigeons stuffed with rice etc. pigeons were a nice surprised with very dark meat but nicely spiced. E had a couple of tajines - but was way too much food for even the four of us.  SUGGESTION - Disclosing the portion size at ordering would help prevent food wastage. We felt bad at how much food we couldn‚Äôt eat. The restaurant on the R level was good for breakfast with representation of varied cultures. Ample types of food for people to decide what to eat. Pool bar - we came later in the day. Rooftop was clean with comfy lounges and couches. We had a couple of cocktails and some nibbles to watch the sun set.  Room COMFORTABLE BED! Slept really well.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"If you live old world charm, this is the place. The bones are beautiful - a cage elevator, grand front doors,  worn marble steps, balconies, floor to ceiling windows. Lively,and very nicely decorated. Beds are good, great wifi and air con, and conveniently above shops that sell snack and cheap water. Also a great, walkable location (and easy to grab an Uber).  The glassed in bathrooms are a creative solution and quite lovely. But they are really only ideal for people who are okay seeing each other on the toilet. Maybe not for besties, or work colleagues, or your dad.  The arranged driver was lovely and waited when we were delayed at airport. And staff Wafaa deserves to be rewarded for her courtesy, attentiveness, and competence.    The only real downside, and the reason we only enjoyed 1 included breakfast, was being cornered for the hard-sell by owner Mustafa. He wanted to change our current plans and pressed us to go to his other property so he could redesign our whole trip. PUSHY. This was so annoying and rude that we have cancelled our plans to return to this hotel at the end of our trip. Just to avoid this dude. Really too bad.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is located very close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum, and a few other old downtown highlights. While the outside of the building looks slightly dilapidated--clearly beyond the control of the hotel--the entrance to the hotel and the interior is nicely done and inviting. Staff are very kind, helpful, and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and have the essentials. In the dining area, complementary tea and water are on offer throughout the day.  A few drawbacks: the street noise is very clearly heard from within the rooms (windows are not double paned), and Cairenes LOVE to honk for any and all reasons so you'll still feel very in touch with street life even within the hotel. Breakfast is rather mediocre: expect toast, hard boiled eggs, some jam, and a small cup of yoghurt, accompanied by tea or nescafe. The bedsheets are in serious need of updating (they are extremely rough and scratchy, making sleeping difficult). The bathrooms are an afterthought - just a corner in the room cordoned off by half-frosted glass, so it is recommended that you are very comfortable sharing all bodily functions with whomever you share the room. Despite a clear 'no smoking' sign at the front desk, staff still smoke in common areas (entry, dining area). We stayed in the room at the far end of the hallway (there are only six rooms) and could smell the smoke very clearly from inside our room with the door shut. When I went to pay for our room at checkout, one staff member sat directly in front of me smoking. I called him out on it, pointing at the 'no smoking' sign right in front of us, and he apologised profusely and moved away with his cigarette. I am 100% confident he resumed smoking inside as soon as we left.  Some of the basics aren't looked after: the room we were given had no pillowcases on three of our four pillows, and only one towel. The rest of the linens were out at the cleaners, and since there was only one person on staff, we had to stand in for the staff at the front desk so they could run out and pick up the clean linen. Rooms don't come with soap, but we were given a bottle of liquid soap when we asked. Early checkin is USD 25 on top of the regular room charge. The staff offered to arrange a car back to the airport on our departure, quoting a price double of what we paid to get from the airport to the hotel in the first place. It is recommended to just take an Uber instead (EGP 100-125, depending on traffic and time of day). Overall, it's not a bad hotel, and the staff's kindness goes a long way to compensate for the weaknesses noted above.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We arrived at the hotel around 10.30 am, too early for check-in. Luckily, our room-to-be had been vacated and the bathroom cleaned, so we could use it and head out for a walk. Thanks to Achmed and Mustafa for that.  But I do not understand why they needed another two hours to get the room ready, when they did not even join the beds as we had requested a double bed at the time of booking or keep any towels when we returned close to 13:00. There were only hand/face towels kept, and even on the second day when we asked for bath towels, we got one, and were reluctantly asked, 'Do you need one more, I'll have to get it from the laundry.' Not being sure if he meant washed or unwashed laundry, we let it pass, lol. The shower fluctuates between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the staff tried their best to get it to work but it didn't, even on the second day. Add to it the tiny glass enclosure which they call a bathroom, there's no room to escape the hot and cold water, I almost got burnt! The glass cubicle idea is very weird, the frosting on the glass could have been complete near the toilet area at least! We stayed two nights, and were given two small bottles of water on the first day. When we asked on the second day, we were told it would be charged! When you check-in to a room, the least you expect is a hot shower, towels and water to drink. Sadly these were missing. The Wifi didn't work either. A special shout out to the lady in-charge of the cafe (I think her name is Ms. Wafa), she was very sweet and very efficient. The room itself was furnished well, with a nice wardrobe ideal for long stays. The two-rating is purely for the location and staff, and well the elevator! Grand Agor probably needs to decide if they want to be a hotel or a hostel. They are right now priced like a hotel with amenities like a hostel. There are much better cheaper places to stay in the downtown area, for once the Tripadvisor reviews did not match my experience, and I regret staying here.‚Ä¶"

The hotel itself is quite new, which is great as the staff are always looking for feedback. The double room was very spacious with a lovely looking bathroom - unfortunately the hot water wasn‚Äôt too consistent so the showers could have been better. The bed was very comfortable, and there was a TV bracket on the wall but no TV. Unfortunately the WiFi was experiencing some issues during our stay so we didn‚Äôt have a great connection.   The hotel staff are just lovely; breakfast each morning was (as others have said) made with love, and the lovely lady would always offer us a tea or coffee when we were around. She really couldn‚Äôt do enough to take care of the guests and was one of our favourite parts of the hotel.   The location is also great, and central enough that you can pop back to use the toilet/have a coffee/take a breather from the Cairo madness, at any point during the day.   We arranged hotel pick up with the hotel after struggling to get in touch with them. If you do the same, make sure you go outside to meet your driver as only police are allowed inside the airport. Price was 25USD return which is very reasonable.   If we visit Cairo again we would stay at the Grand Agor - definitely recommend it.   The hotel also arranges tours for guests - we took one to the pyramids which was 20USD for both of us. Definitely do this. Avoid he public transport. Giza is hectic and stressful enough without waiting around for a bus! ‚Ä¶"

First off, do not let the entrance to the building where the hotel is distract you, it looks rough at best, but once you are inside the hotel, it is very nice. The staff is the friendliest you can find anywhere in the world, the rooms are wide and comfortable and  you get a feeling like you are staying at your friends house, and not actually at a hotel. Plus its location is very very good, right in downtown, near the museum, metro station, stores, etc. Last but not least the lift is very peculiar, not only is it very peculiar on the way it operates, but has its own theme music when moving, I know this sounds very odd, and it is, but for us it added a very special touch.‚Ä¶"

My kids were really happy with all of it. We also got breakfast boxes packed for us. Starting our trip here kicked off our Egypt explorations to a great start.

It was so touching that when they realised our love for Mango they prepared a surprising Mango feast for us. It was very touching to us.

Example - told iced-tea is a special order.  While it is expected that people at local venues may not speak English, it is reasonable to expect staff at the concierge, reception and restaurant should be able to communicate in English.  COVID has left many businesses understaffed,  Ritz-Carlton should be able to procure more experienced employees or at least provide them with better training."

All services from the restaurant and chamber maids, to the chic lounge with delicious desserts, we absolutely loved our stay. Down to the beds and bedding sheets, it was perfect. Thank you The Nile Ritz Carlton for a brilliant stay!! I highly recommended it!!"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Cairo direct on the Nile River and a stone throw away from the Egyptian National museum. Many great restaurants and bars are close by and easy reachable within a 5 minute taxi ride. The hotel, rooms and staff were exactly what we expected from a Ritz Carlton Hotel, just perfect."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger and longer Egypt trip. We'd certainly start off by saying what a perfect location this property is, right at Tahrir Square and the Egyptian Museum. It's so close as well to many of the hip restaurants around this side of the Nile. The hotel itself is well secured, and the moment you pass through the metal detectors into the lobby, you are greeted by a fantastic Guest Relations team and a wonderful public space on the ground floor. In fact, all of the public areas seem current, well maintained and appointed with everything you would need. However, once we got to the room the story was a little different: we had a junior-suite, overlooking Tahrir Square, and off the bat our A/C was not working properly (specifically, the thermostat was not functioning, no matter what we changed the temperature to there was no change). The room also had an older smell, maybe even a smokey smell that was apparent each time you would walk in. The bathroom were huge and very clean, but had older fixtures with discoloration. Much of the room had this, in fact, with some parts of the ceiling having dry wall cracking and leaving little white crumbs around. Did any of this inhibit our experience? Not really, as the service makes up for it. But it's not exactly what I'd expect from The Ritz-Carlton. I'd like to give a final shout-out to Mina Aziz from Guest Relations: he made sure every request we had was fulfilled and even helped make some special cases work for us. Any future visits to Cairo would still have us staying here over any other option.‚Ä¶"

The gym is large with treadmills, ellipticals, and a plethora of weights and machines. We love a large gym and I will add extra time in the morning for this one. The breakfast is a huge display of every option you could imagine. The lobby piano is a nice way to enjoy their treats. Having a bank on sight helps when getting out cash and change. Enjoy your stay"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"** POSITIVE ** Firstly the staff were almost excellent, majority of the time were very attentive and assisted with my needs.  Food was a decent spread of international/ local cuisine and promptly served     **NEGATIVE** Now the bad  - ROOM ALLOCATION  Despite me asking around 2/3 times at check-in to have a room away from noise and any events they put me in a room right beneath the top bar.  Consequently every night at around 2AM loud music would reverberate into my room to the sounds of Despacito.  As you can imagine I asked if I could be moved again 2/3 times where they would answer let me get back to you and nothing happened.  For a work trip this is really not acceptable.  Did I also mention as well we saw a mouse run across the lobby!  - THIRD PARTY CHAUFFER On Wednesday last week we hired a car from the hotel from the ‚ÄòMUSTANG COMPANY‚Äô.  I had forgot my wallet in the car getting out which I realised 2 min entering my room.  Upon receiving it back from the driver I noticed all the money had been taken out (USD/AED).  I spoke to the managers Mr Hossam/ Ahmed right away who informed me they would investigate to no avail.    Their rationale it‚Äôs a third party company where there is nothing they can do.  Whilst I understand it would be very hard to prove, this is the RITZ not a 2 star BNB and they should use reputable providers.  In my 14 years travelling for work I‚Äôve never had anything like this which is a real shame.  Its important to highlight the facts above in case there are any other travellers who have experienced the same.‚Ä¶"

During breakfast, the staff in the cafeteria gave us mean glimpse, and did not serve us well. There is a waiter called Osman who was very mean. The hotel is nice but the staff are not nice to black people, our white colleague was treated well most of the time. For that reason, one star from me."

It is in a green area with plenty of villas, quiet and peaceful, a relief to busy and dusty Cairo. It is fournished Laura Ashley style, and makes you realy nostalgic. We hoped to enjoy one of the two swimming pools and take a last sunbeam, but in this time of the year the pools are both in the shadow. We took diner in the evening in the beautiful garden near the pool. The food was delicious, but they don't have a wine card. They don't serve alcoholic drinks, but customers are allowed to bring bottles from outside the hotel, we saw several regulars with their own bottle at the table. Minus was the next morning, as we had to take an early flight and our breakfast was included in the price, I agreed with the staff in the lobby that they would bring it in the room before our departure. Only they brought us to bags to take in the taxi, not very comfortable. We left the bags untouched for the taxi driver.‚Ä¶"

The hotel is in a very nice part of Cairo, hard to reconcile the lushness here with the normal Egyptian scenery of sand dunes and camels. There are various embassies and institutes nearby and a big police presence which was reassuring The hotel itself is a colonial residence and quaint. Certainly, very different from the chains. The ambience within is that of a boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I was very happy with my room and the amenities. My only quibble was the wi-fi and not particularly comfortable work conditions The outside seating area is lovely to sit out the sunset. The pool is small but nice, but is in the dining area, and so you have limited access if you are working, so I had to make sure to return early to make use of it. Many of the reviews mention the food.  Out of necessity I are there all 3 nights I stayed. I found the food to be mediocre. I later stayed in other hotels nearby and found some brilliant places to eat and regret I was not more adventurous when I stayed at the Belle Epoque If I was being a tourist and not working, I would certainly recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1722944-Reviews-Villa_Belle_Epoque-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I seldom write reviews. But I saw the mix bag of reviews for Belle Epoque, I felt the need to chime in.  I am not a big hotel kind of a traveler. So, when I booked the flights to Cairo, I started looking. This was the only (or the only nice looking) boutique hotel I found. Some friends warned me Egypt doesn't do boutique hotels well, and yes, the reviews freaked me out a bit. But I couldn't bring myself to book one of those chain hotels... so I took a gamble.  It paid off. Really paid of!  The neighborhood is tree-filled, lush green, relaxed and quiet residential area loved by embassies and posh locals. Lots of nice restaurants, cafes, shops within walking distance. Locals told me they walk everywhere in this neighborhood. Many also told me they often come to Belle Epoque  for the pool, or for lunch.  You may spend your day in the hustle bustle of busy chaotic Cairo doing tourists stuff, so why not pick the most laid back beautiful villa to go back to relax at night? I loved Cairo, and I am definitely coming back. And when I am coming back, I will definitely stay here again.  PS: beautifully decorated spacious rooms, nice and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"

There is a socket converter for international traveler as well thought it‚Äòs a bit ropey.  As for cons, it locates at a construction zone so it can be dusty and noisy.

Anyways the duty manager there did nothing to help he said that he checked the cameras in corridors and no one had entered our rooms. To cut it short my rooms safe box at my arrival was not working and when i asked the receptionist to get it fix he came with a box full of keys and had reset it and left and the sexond day this happened.  Even the taxi we had asked to pick us took us directly to the way to airport while we hadn‚Äôt told them too so when we asked him he is going to the wrong way he said that the guy at the hotel said you are going to the airport as i think they thought we are going back home to our country.  This is just a bad experience but definitely true as we both friends in different rooms got some money missing from our saftey box.  Please be careful thats is my message.‚Ä¶"

The hotel is located in the Zamalek district, in an area well connected to the points of interest of the city and at the same time a quiet area. the breakfast was good and with excellent pastries"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is in a good location and the room was clean, the bed comfortable. If you ask, you can get eggs cooked fresh for breakfast.  However, I requested a superior room because the room details stated that superior rooms have a balcony, and mine did not. This was very disappointing since this was the only reason I requested a superior room. Instead, it had a kitchenette which is strange and made it feel like a self contained apartment rather than a superior room in a hotel. I would have been better off with a regular room. Not long after I arrived, after waiting almost an hour past checkin time as the room was not ready, foul smelling water poured from an outlet under the sink, although I had not turned on the tap. The maintenance man did not listen when I explained where the water was coming from and that I had not turned on the tap, and instead fixed what would have been another problem had I done so, the broken pipe leading from the sink to the outlet above where the water came from. He also fixed a blockage which may have temporarily solved the mystery water issue. A young man came and carefully mopped the floor with antiseptic and clean water, but the smell lingered in the kitchenette for the duration of my stay, which fortunately was only one night.  When I went to have a shower I found the hot water was barely lukewarm, not matter how long I let the tap run for. There was no hot water in this room the entire stay.  Overall, it was overpriced for what I got, even for Zamalek.‚Ä¶"

The location is fantastic and in the heart of Egypt‚Äôs finest neighborhood, Zamalek. Within a walking distance, you will find countless shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarkets and pharmacies. Literally everything you will ever need.  The hotel has some nice bars and restaurants. For a hotel this size, I was surprised they have some good options for a drink or a meal.  The room is small but very clean and you wouldn‚Äôt need it much if you are planning to move around.   Staff are generally very helpful and polite which is again something you might not find in 5-star hotels around Cairo.  Now when it comes to the cons of this hotel. It will be the elevator which is very slow and tiny so if the hotel is busy, you will suffer a bit.  Also, there‚Äôs no soundproofing system so you can hear everything happening next door but the managers were very supportive to control this.  I will definitely be staying here again.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This review is regarding day use at the Gabriel hotel pool.  I have been here more than 20 times for day use and ive spent the night 4 times and used to be a big fan. But since Andrew left its gone down the toilet. First of all we booked through the whatsapp booking. They asked for photo i.d of all my friends that wanted to come. Kind of ridiculous. Then they wanted all our facebook accounts. Presumably to check we dont look ugly or poor. Again ridiculous, this is a swimming pool not Studio 54. We are two couples in our 30s40s. We should not have to show a stupid social media presence to enter a pool. On arrival they told us that the reservation was to reserve attendance not to reserve sunbeds. That's not what a reservation is. So there were no umbrellas left and not enough sunbeds for our group (3 present and 2 joining later). There was one double bed left right next to the showers and speakers - least desirable spot. We asked for a spare sunbed to be bought over and put beside our bed as we are a group of 5. They refused. Said it was too difficult and just kept repeating ""no way"" because according to the obnoxious attendance the beds fit 7 people. The bed was the width of 3 pillows meaning if three people laid side by side like sardines they could fit, but not comfortably. I can guarantee no egyptian woman would be expected to be 7 to a sunbed but screw the white chicks they can suck it up? After an extended argument they put a sunbed next to the double bed which was no difficulty at all. We then asked for the spare umbrella but they refused saying the umbrellas that were ironically on wheels could not be moved. We had driven a long way so chose to stay, but without any shade we left after 3 hours. We would have liked to spend the day - the hottest day of the year so far. Its also important to mention that the dj blasts annoying house music too loud. They wont turn it down. This has been a problem on another visit when we were the only family at the pool and they still wouldnt turn it down a fraction. We couldn't talk  side by side without shouting.  Also on another visit when we had to be vetted on our facebook to make sure we were not scumbags there were people so ridiculously drunk they vomitted in the pool. We reported it to the waiter who went over to have a word and walked away with their drinks order! Its gotten gradually worse, but this visit really was the limit. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.‚Ä¶"

It‚Äôs just a small hotel (arround 25 rooms) without buffet breakfast, broken cheap-fancy furniture, and minimum cleaning.   The hotel itself is a party for Egiptian people: starting in the pool (where you can‚Äôt simply relax because of the noise of ‚Äúthe music‚Äù - arabian reggeton‚Ä¶ later on the party continues in the ‚Äúrestaurant area‚Äù which is exactly in the middle of the hotel, so you can easily hear the excesively loud music from your room till very after the midnigth‚Ä¶  The breakfast is poor, and defficient quality. People attending the tables don‚Äôt speak english, and what you get isn‚Äôt frequently what you really ordered.  We choosed this hotel because of it‚Äôs nearby the airport, and it‚Äôs side by side to a big shopping mall (SunCity) which is mostly dead (5 floors and only very very few shops open).  Deffinetly I do not recommend this property unless you are looking for bad rest, egiptian partys all the time, bad food and a barely dead surrounding.  FAR, VERY FAR FROM A 5 STARS‚Ä¶ run away!‚Ä¶"

The minute We pulled up  to the property We were greeted at the car with the bell man waiting to collect our bags and guide us to the front desk. Izzy who works at the front desk, had everything ready and waiting for our arrival, she was 10 steps ahead lol and I can appreciate that. Thank you Izzy!! They try their best to accommodate your requests. 5/5 for customer service and staff. Cleanliness of the room 5/5 and comfort 5/5. Did not like that the bar was close for the nights we stayed there so that really was our only con about our stay. I definitely recommend the Gabriel, two thumbs up!"

There was also a party in the main restaurant with loud music that we could listen in our rooms. Horrible!"

This excellent hotel is part of a Supermall in the up n coming section of ‚ÄúNew Cairo‚Äù. It allows some window shopping, as many stores are empty, where the affluent Egyptians partake and has an interesting food court if the two restaurants remain closed as during our stay.  15 minutes taxi from airport and an interesting location for those not interested in venturing into Cairo, it combines top notch service with an eclectic and curious ambiance. All the comforts and conveniences you have likely missed during your Egypt tour, await you here. We missed out on the restaurant review as it was closed for a private event (unusual) but the room service was excellent and delicious."

Spacious rooms with high ceiling and hardwood floor, each one has its own decoration and spirit, some with balconies with columns. Many different configurations available, just ask: with AC or ceiling fan (we tried both, fan was enough even in summer), with or without shower and toilets in the the room (but the communal bathrooms are also very clean), all with at least a sink, single, double, double + single bed for families, on the street (vibrant city vibe) or on the back lane (very quiet). Very clean, comfortable and functional. Same for the communal spaces, large TV salon and dining room. Possible to order lunch and dinner too.

I stayed here previously in 2006. The place has not changed much except for it now has WiFi. The Internet was quite fast. One of the reasons I chose the Roma was because it has rooms with balconies or windows you can open. Ventilation is critical during pandemics so that is not to be sneezed at. (Pun intended.)   The other great thing is the staff here are very helpful but they are not trying to sell you tours. They helped me with getting my pre-flight PCR test and getting a reliable early morning driver for my BJJ lessons.   A few tips.   Mosquitoes are a fact of life in budget hotels in Cairo. There is a pharmacy/chemist nearby where you can get spray on repellent. Once I did that I had a better night sleep.   Traffic noise and the Mosques are loud. If you are a light sleeper get earplugs.  Uber and Careem drivers are difficult to find in before 0700. If you have to go somewhere early ask the staff to recommend a cab driver.   This probably doesn't apply for most. If you want Brazilian Jiu Jitsu lessons Google ""Anubis Martial Arts Cairo"". üòÄ  I'll be back again.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d309020-Reviews-Pension_Roma-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Pension Roma is our favourite hotel in Cairo and the place we always go back to when in the city. I almost feel bad not wanting to try any other hotel in Cairo. From the first day we fell in love with the hotel, it's perfectly preserved in time, from the moment you step into the old building, the elevator, a gem of the old days. I think there is a recently remodelled area which is also great but I just fell in love with the original, more 'vintage' area.  We always choose the same room which is very big, clean, and comfy with a sink and closet. The bathroom is always kept squeaky clean. The common areas-- dining room and living room-- are just mesmerizing;  you feel in early XX century Cairo. The breakfast is always a joy, such a nice atmosphere to plan your day or write some notes.  The price is very good, honestly one of the best price-quality in the world. The staff  is truly 5 stars. Always helpful and very nice. They even do their best and give us the room we like! We also met the owner and she is such a nice lady.   The location is just great as  it is sooo central you can walk to Tahrir and the museum, Islamic Cairo, Jezirah... pretty much anywhere in central Cairo is no more than 15 minutes walking distance. There is a metro station about 4 minutes walking where you can go to Giza for a couple EP and  then take a local bus straight to the pyramids. Lots of yummy options to eat around, you are in the heart of downtown Cairo.‚Ä¶"

The staff is lovely, all is clean, all works efficient.Maybe they could change some matresses or pillows every up and then but that is all. We stayed for a week and really liked it. Also my friends who traveled to Cairo for the first time with us.  We will be back later during the year.. Looking already forward to."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d309020-Reviews-Pension_Roma-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Not all old is gold. The Windsor hotel for instance is a mummified relic of the past. But here at Pension Roma there's friendly service, huge rooms, spotless cleanliness, and real service. (For instance, my bed was made up every day - *with* the extra blanket I needed, as requested.)  The pension is perhaps a little faded. One of the toilets is temperamental when it comes to refilling the cistern, mosquitoes get everywhere (though that may be true of the whole of Cairo), and breakfast is basic (request Turkish coffee if you need a kickstart). The lift has its little tantrums, too. And the downside of a location close to Ataba station and downtown Cairo is that it can be pretty noisy.   But Madame is elegant and keeps her staff honest and hard working. The TV room is a good place to meet other guests and the TV provides CNN, BBC and al-Jazeera in English. Wifi is free and works 90% of the time (staff are always happy to reboot the router). The laundry is impeccable; my linen shirts came back pressed, spotless, and most important, with all their buttons :- ) And tea at 15 Egyptian pounds for a big pot is available all hours.   This is just my kind of place; not so posh I feel I need to dress up, not so down at heel I feel grimy, and good value for money.‚Ä¶"

It is still as welcoming as ever. It‚Äôs lost a wee bit of charm over the years.  We had a problem with mosquitos in our room. My 4yo had 15 bite marks on his face alone, 25-30 more on his arms and legs. Nearly the same for my wife and our 5yo boy.   The building is also under construction and there is a LOT of jackhammering starting at 7am going on until evening time.   The water is still as difficult as ever to adjust and water pressure stinks. If they could fix the showers it would be soooo much better.   It‚Äôs sadly fallen off our radar as we have kids who love to bathe. That and the mosquito issue.   If you‚Äôre a seasoned traveler without kids, then give it a try. It‚Äôs gotten a bit pricey, $20-38USD, but still better than some other options in the area.‚Ä¶"

Good location with comfortable bed and a convenient airport pick up. That said the floor blackened our feet, the curtains had a strange smell and without a shower curtain or mat the small bathroom always had a wet floor. The pictures I think are very dated as the common seating area has seen a lot of traffic, is dusty, uncomfortable and not a pleasant place to have the breakfast of bread, jam and cheese.

Good accommodation provided for the price that was paid.  The room and shared bathroom were clean and everything worked as it should.  There are heaps of great places to eat close by the hotel and the staff can offer suggestions on where to try.  The included breakfast was basic but adequate.  The included wi-fi was a bit hit and miss but this was the same all over Egypt.  The staff were professional and friendly.  They had offered us free pick up from the airport but unfortunately when we arrived there was no one there to meet us.  Apparently they organised it for the wrong time.  We booked a tour of Giza through them for a reasonable price.  All in all we were happy with the service provided and would stay here again.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1799808-Reviews-Traveler_s_House_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We had a 3-day stay at this hostel after reading many great reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel staff were knowledgeable about the area and were able to recommend some favourite local restaurants. I wasn't too keen on having a shared bathroom, but the rooms with a private bathroom were sold out when we booked.  The room was clean and simple when we arrived. There was an armoire for us to store our clothing. The A/C had a bucket to collect drips underneath, but this was never a problem. There were two shared bathrooms to use and they were kept clean and stocked with toilet paper. During our stay, we never had issues with the bathrooms being occupied when we needed them. The common room has books to borrow, and satellite TV, but no A/C. Despite our room overlooking a busy street (during Ramadan), we didn't find the noise to be too loud. Unlimited fresh towels were provided, and Wifi is free (and signal strength good) in all rooms.  You can't beat the hotel location. It is so central that you don't need a taxi to visit the shopping district (July 26th street and Ataba Market), many restaurants, and several attractions (Tahrir Square, Museum, Nile Corniche). The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ramses Train Station which was very convenient for us.‚Ä¶"

Their rooms and bathrooms are basic and also clean.  The owner and his staffs are all good people to talk to. And they are willing to help and give advice on anything relating to having a good time in Cairo or Egypt.  They can arrange airport transfers and if you book atleast a certain number of nights, you will get a free transfer.   Location wise is in downtown, busy area and don't have to worry about safety late at night as the area is always filled with people. You can hear traffic from the room, so prepare earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  There are lots of restaurants to eat at and there is a confectionery right opposite the hostel.  I got a free upgrade to a room with 4 beds and attached bathroom despite booking for single bed shared bathroom.  In all, I recommend this hostel for budget travellers.‚Ä¶"

The host Adel and the staff Jasmine are super kind and helpful.  Jasmine is not just a worker there but becomes one of my best foreign friends, she took me to the famous traditional Koshary restaurant and even cooked for me the night before I left.    This is not a high-class hotel, but definitely a warm place if you want to make some friends and take rest.  The location is also very nice, you can easily grab the best dessert downstairs because the best El Abd is just across the street from travelers house.  It only takes around 10-15 mins by walk to the museum as well.  The only thing I would expect more is that they can refinish the room if they plan to make something different.  Some of the furnitures and facilities are not quite new.  But for a backpacker like me, this is still a nice place to stay.‚Ä¶"

The hotel only has plastic and paper disposable dixie cups ! They have no ice buckets and the best I could get was a plastic bag full - the place has no class of any kind.

Pros: Perfect location in the middle of Midan Tahrir with a magnificent view of the square from my room window  Friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping. Large room and electric kettle and bottled water supplied daily. The hotel is connected to La Poire one of Cairo's better known cafes.  Cons: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation with stained carpets. The bathroom leaked from both the sink and the shower. The drain in the shower didn't work and flooded the bathroom everytime I took a shower. Breakfast was basic and tasteless.  This hotel is not  cheap for the mediocre quality it offers  and  needs renovation soon. Just to add that the clientele was mainly Arab from various Arab countries with some Westerners and Africans.‚Ä¶

Aside from one person in the reception, the others were terrible. The one who greeted me in was unwelcoming. After taking my passport information and charging my card, he got a personal phone call and he stepped away leaving me there standing for several minutes without any information from the room or other. When he came back, he rudely said that the bellman would guide me to the room. Staff definitely needs urgent training on manners, politeness and being welcoming in general. Breakfast was terrible. Don't bother to book this hotel with breakfast (they offer a pre-packaged version that is not fresh at all). It is better to go to the small cafe place on the corner that provides excellent options."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The correct way to advertise Nile View hotel would be. Stay in a -5 star old rundown boat watching toxic waste dumping in the river. With an old rustic black mold infested carpet and mold in sink and shower and for entertainment staff entering your room late at night. And for a bonus get sick from the food and stay on the toilet looking at the Mold in the sink and shower. And for your safety in the event of an emergency there is a dirty old mattress in the hallway that you can hide under to keep you safe from predators. This is an experience of a lifetime. You can book this exciting holiday on Nile View deceptive website. Nile View hotels advertising is very misleading. It‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel it's a nothing star disgusting filthy old rundown boat that was so bad we both got very sick from the deplorable conditions. There is black mold everywhere in the carpet on the walls in the sink on the floors this was the most disgusting rundown hotel we have ever stayed at. And even the ceiling was falling apart. We witnessed hotel employees dumping toxic waste in the Nile. This hotel should not be allowed to be open as it is a health hazard. Our stay on the dirty old boat was a nightmare. Just read the numerous negative reviews and look at actual pictures posted by myself and others that stayed at Nile View they tell the truth. And no matter what lies Nile View post it does not change this fact ‚Ä¶

I enjoyed very much my stay with German group of 20 who nearly cancelled their booking from Feb, 28 till Mar. 02, 2020 only because we discovered that this great boat relocated in Maddi and still not open.  Instead, boat management was thoughtful enough to arrange for an A/C brand new shuttle bus dialy! First we thought this is only to & from the museum only. But we were mostly pleased to discover that this thoughtfulness extents to every where, any time and any numbers of time! Thoughtfulness is reflected in staff attitude as well! We and the owner are really lucky to have this staff who LOVE the boat, love their work and care soooooo much for customer satisfaction. I barely had the chance to order anything! They care enough to fullfil every need and any remark before you even say it!!  Nile view Zamalek (now Maadi): you made me proud, you made all the guests happy, you gave us such a wonderful experience that I want really to thank each and every one of you. I can't believe how caring, clean and kind every one of you are! It's not just hospitality it's true kindness & care coming from professional people who received us befoooooore getting readying and finishing innovations! But they really made a ""hard to please group"" ; feel home. Can't thank you enough, we will sure be back to see you after renovations After special entrance gate is finished. After sundeck and covered pool are ready  Food there is unforgettable! I had the most wonderful kabsa, the best hawawshy and an amaaaazing mixed grill. Breakfast buffet is memorable! Oh my God! What great bakery do they have!!! Best omlette in town! Tameya is fried before you. All kinds of hot drinks! Real fresh orange juice. Real care and morning smile. Even if you are in a hurry, they would notice and make you the best snacks to go! O my God after 2 days I'm still overwhelmed with your kindness people! I remember each and every name of you: Reception: Ahmed, Sheriff Mostafa & Adel. Room service: Refaat Food and beverage: Nabieh Omlette stand: Hamad (very caring) Chief at the kitchen is the best (not sure about the name) Even room cleaning: Maha Bill man. Security men who would help you park your car. Everyone .. I'm sorry I haven't met you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Can't wait till I'm back.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Please note that this hotel would not keep any rooms for you even after they confirm you that a room (or rooms) is reserved for you. They just look at the rooms available when you check in and assign one of the available rooms to you. They just don‚Äôt care if the available room is not of the type you requested.  We reserved two rooms for 3 nights and requested that they should be next to each other. The hotel staff acknowledged and sent me an email with confirmation numbers. This happened 4 months before our stay. But still, when we checked in, they gave us rooms in two different sections of the hotel. Essam (not sure how it is spelt) was at the front desk and he was extremely uncooperative. He was adamant that those were the only rooms available even though our reservation was confirmed 4 months in advance. He finally told us that he would give us two adjacent rooms the next day.  But the next day, Essam did the same thing again. He reassigned rooms to us but in two different sections again. We argued with him again but it was of no use. This man would try strongly NOT to help customers. Fortunately for us, there was one more person at the front desk and he tried to help us. His name was Ahmed. After listening to our request, he found out that there were two adjacent rooms available on a different floor and he assigned them to us. Our request was finally accommodated. Our first positive experience at this hotel was with Ahmed.   I had another weird experience at this hotel. I went to the restaurant on the roof top one day. Instead of directing me to a table, the waiter asked me, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù. I then asked him, ‚ÄúDo you have vegetarian food?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhat is vegetarian food?‚Äù I was stunned! He was a waiter at a restaurant and he didn‚Äôt even know what vegetarian food was. This place is obviously run by weird guys.  The only other positive experience was with the staff at the breakfast. They were all nice and friendly.‚Ä¶"

Well I am glad that we stuck with our plan, the location is perfect, views of the Nile in the evening are stunning we ate all our meals for the two days we were there in the restaurant and we couldn't fault anything. The breakfast were really good as well with a large selection of fruits meats pastries etc. Yes the ""rooms"" are not big but they are cabins not rooms, this is a Nile Boat not a hotel! The rooms were clean and everything worked.The staff were all amazing and tried their best, there were a few language issues as this is not a tourist establishment but frequented mostly by local people. We were always made to feel most welcome by the other guests and even joined in the festivities of a birthday party and an engagement party. the only complain was yes there is a smell of cigarette smoke in corridors etc but the is Egypt there is no such thing as a non smoking area.Would go back there again.‚Ä¶"

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!  Final Question? ‚Ä¶.. why is the same sandwich served three different ways in three days ‚Ä¶ the F&B director needs to question why standards are not being followed‚Ä¶"

Very good location and attentive staff.  Our room was large, bed very comfortable and we enjoyed sitting on little deck over looking the Nile and the city.  The dinner and breakfast buffet was extensive, food well prepared and there was room for people to move around without banging into each other.  All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d299113-Reviews-InterContinental_Cairo_Semiramis_an_IHG_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The worst reception and service I have ever had in a so-called 5-star hotel. No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.   The ambassador club is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen, out of all the intercontinentales I‚Äôve visited. Only the one in Seoul is of the same caliber.   The location is perfect, right on the Nile and next door to the museum."

THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "

The staff is absolutely over the top polite, helpful and professional. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and the bathrooms are enormous with separate WC and bidet. Best of all though are the restaurants and downstairs lobby tea bar which transport you to another era. The Chinese restaurant (The name is 8)  was so excellent and the service was so incredible that we would‚Äôve eaten there every night but forced ourselves to explore other places, none comparable. Excellent designer shops also inside the hotel and fantastic concierge who helped us book some amazing tours and a sunset faluka boat tour with wine."

My room was facing the road opposing the zoo and there was a lot of noise at night. I had the impression that the balcony door was open. I was staying in a deluxe room but i saw no difference from the standard room, maybe more corridor room. The restaurant/bar at the pool wasn't great: they closed earlier than advertised and the drinks at the bar were awful. They don't know how to make a manhattan and the caipirinha was the worst i have ever had. Please also watch out: at check out, the desk person converted my Egyptian Pound invoice into USD and then proceeded to charge my credit card in GBP with a 4.5% markup without informing me. I pointed out to him that he was supposed to ask me in which currency i wanted to settle the bill, not decide for me. He tried to say that it was not him and that the machine automatically converted to GBP but i let him know that this was not teh first time i was checking out of a hotel with a credit card. Very dishonest and Unprofessional from a hotel of that standard. The 4.5% markup cost me an additional ¬£120. I don't know if the management told them to do this but it left me with a very bitter taste at the end of my stay.‚Ä¶"

It was directly across from the Cairo Zoo which was in terrible shape and detracted from the overall ambiance. We traveled during Covid and the security was pretty obvious even though the hotel was mostly empty.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the ambiance of the hotel. Great swimming pool with large deck area and food service.  Hotel has eight restaurants in which we dined and all of which have superb food and service. They had our room ready for our 5:30 AM arrival and provided late checkout to accommodate our late airline schedule. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this great hotel.

Having stayed at a variety of FS properties all over the world, I would not hesitate to highly recommend this hotel to even the most seasoned FS customers.  Though the property itself may not be as fancy as some of the FS hotels in other locations, it was the staff who made our stay above and beyond our (already high) expectations of FS service. There was nothing too big or small that they couldn‚Äôt accommodate. The concierge was amazing with helping us book all of the tours, excursions, travel we needed assistance  with. And when we needed to fly back early from a day trip to Luxor because one of our family members was having a health issue related to the extreme heat, they took care of all of the logistics.  Cairo is a very overwhelming city that can have significant language and cultural barriers to the North American traveller and the FS Cairo Nile is there to help navigate and make sure your trip is amazing. I would not hesitate to recommend this property.‚Ä¶"

This is a review of The Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.   I stayed here last week for a couple of nights and everything was great. They were able to check me in early which was a bonus. I made use of the spa area and had a treatment, which was reasonably priced.   The outdoor pool area is a lovely oasis from the bustling and chaotic city, so I went down to the pool for a few hours a couple of times.   The restaurant for breakfast is spacious and has nice River views, and plenty of different options.   All staff were attentive and helpful."

First of all the room is neat and tidy.  Housekeeping team is doing a good job. And the receptionists are friendly and polite especially Mr. Rady.   The reason I rated this hotel 3/5 because, 1. The complimentary breakfast is same everyday and it‚Äôs not in international standard. The breakfast is not recommended for non-Egyptians.  2. There are 16 floors in this hotel and there is only one lift. You can imagine the wait time for the lift to come. Lift is always busy and we have to wait long to get the lift.  It‚Äôs better to stay in lower floor..  The lobby is not so clean as you can find lots of bees."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1635921-Reviews-Swiss_Inn_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"By far one of the worst hotels I've been to in my life. There is a problem with the rooms and service staff. We had to change rooms twice, the first room was dirty, a peice of the sink fell off in the middle of the night scaring us, and some furniture was missing.   The second room was a nightmare, the bathroom stunk of sewer and rotten egg and the AC leaked like a waterfall. We complained about the AC the night it started leaking, then again the next morning, then again during the afternoon. In the afternoon, housekeeping came and put a bucket under the AC to fix the problem. After complaining for the 4th time, the maintenance guy came and hit the AC with a broom as it was his way of repairing it. Of course this strategy did not work and the AC started leaking again at 11PM. We called the reception and maintenance and they only showed up to our room at 11:35 PM after 4 phone calls. The maintenance guy requested the reception to change our room as fixing the AC would take a lot of time, they refused. The maintenance workers started using machinery to fix the AC as we were in the room.  Finally they changed our rooms to a better one at almost 1AM because I was crying hysterically in the reception from exhaustion because I had a morning flight the next day.   Oh and they left a full trash bag (that was not ours) in front of the room for an entire night.  Please save yourselves the trouble a book another hotel.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d497919-Reviews-Lotus_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The Lotus Hotel is an excellent place to stay in downtown Cairo, depending on what you want. If you want to stay in same-same sterile modern international standard accommodation, you wouldn‚Äôt choose the Lotus Hotel. If, however, you seek old-world charm (without the fancy makeover that has arguably spoilt so many of the old-world hotels in Egypt), the Lotus is a really great choice. The rooms are simply furnished, very clean, & very adequate. The highlight of the hotel is the staff, who are wonderfully kind, helpful, welcoming, & 100% genuine in their care of their guests. The hotel is in a great downtown location, with plenty of local caf√©s, bars, restaurants, & shops in easy walking distance. I stayed at the Lotus on 3 occasions during my recent visit to Egypt. It will be my preferred choice on my next visit too. ‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d497919-Reviews-Lotus_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"It's hard to put into words how special my time was Lotus Hotel. As a single and first-time traveler to Cairo, it was the perfect place to stay for a week, and understand what daily life is like. I was able to walk to so many places once I felt confident with the rhythm of the streets (thanks to Samir Fayek). This place has so much character and warmth to share even if it's not a ""luxurious"" hotel. (Personally, I'm more interested in the depth and a story -- if you're looking for that, you will find it here. ) Ayman, Emad, Abeer, Ibrahim, and Adel (and others that I know I'm forgetting, sorry!) made me feel so welcome and couldn't have been more gracious. On my next trip to Egypt, no matter where I am, I will go out of my way to return to Lotus to say hello to everyone there. Mr. Wafik Doss (owner of the hotel) is a gem and a true professional in the world of hospitality, and I will continue to stay at his hotels in the future when I'm back in Cairo. Mr. Doss kindly introduced me to Mina and Samir Fayek (tour guide experts) that I highly recommend using if you're staying at Lotus or Windor. (They've been working together for ~40 years.) Wafik and the Fayek Tour Guides work from their hearts; I was lucky enough to experience it and will be forever grateful.‚Ä¶"

The hotel has been around some time, having survived the ups and downs of the tourism industry. It offers good value for money and the staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak English - some well. The beds are comfortable and the hotel gives a choice of western or Egyptian breakfast included in the very reasonable rates. I liked the manager very much and found him very helpful during the difficult 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. I almost had to stay on after the Cairo airport closed and would have felt safe there for weeks if that had happened. The hotel is well located too - close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum and many restaurants and other amenities."

It's a ten minute walk to the museum and plenty of eating options close by.  The hotel is an old time kind of place but I liked it. It had character.  The people who worked there also were friendly and and good banter. There is a bar upstairs where you can get a beer and chill out after the sightseeing during the day.  If any criticism maybe the breakfasts could be better. However for the price and the quality of the rooms ,mine with a balcony I found the place to my liking.  If I ever go back it will be there. Or possibly the Windsor hotel the one I should of been in which is the sister hotel closed for now. Keep up the good work guys.  We will return one day !!"

It dates to 1950 and has had no major renovation since then. For those on a budget and who are familiar with 1 and 2 star hotels, the Lotus is a great choice. This means weak WiFi, iffy plumbing, thin towels, and simple bkfst. It has a fun bar, a restaurant, they'll do laundry, and you can walk to downtown sites. Some devoted foreign guests (it has its fans) but mostly Egyptian. The bar has a hipster on a budget vibe."

The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work!

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶.

Lucky for us, the hotel is almost complete with their renovations and as a result, our rooms were amazing.  The website does not do the hotel enough justice.   In addition to this, the hotel staff had great security around the clock, prompt room assistance, excellent restaurants with many different food options, and is overall reasonably priced.    I give them my best recommendation."

It is a lovely hotel having  rooms with views of the Nile and a nice restaurant.  It is large so there is lots of room to wander and relax.  The management gave us a very late checkout without charge so we could catch a late flight to the US.  In the restaurant we were well taken care of by IMAN and the bell hop Ashfar made sure our Uber arrived on time and stayed with us until he arrived.

The Hotel was going to a major renovation and is surely making a very big uplift to the Hotel and the quality of the stay.

He even went as far as calling the hotel we were booked at in sharm el sheikh to arrange for them to send a car to the airport to collect us as our transfer had failed. It seemed nothing was too much trouble. If you stay here please introduce yourselves to Amr as if there is anything that you need he will assist with a smile.

Thanks for Mr. Khalil from the swimming area for always setting up nice lounges in the shade close to each other as we were 10 people.   Room dining has improved significantly over the years. We ordered burger and chicken nuggets on multiple occasions. Always fresh with quality meat/ chicken. What you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d543043-Reviews-Cairo_World_Trade_Center_Hotel_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is by far THE worst ever. Everything was covered in dust in the room, we booked for a two week stay and unfortunately due to it being non refundable we had to live with the situation. Despite our daily complaints and reminders about how many guests are in the suite we never received the right amount of cutlery, the eggs were never cooked the way we asked which was simple ‚Äúwell done‚Äù it was always runny, the bathrooms were not clean at all, the balcony door would not shut completely, the window lock on one of the bedrooms would fall off as soon as we opened the window. These were not even the big issues.  We arrived on the 13th and today is the 22nd the water supply to the hotel was cut off. When we spoke to the staff/management they had claimed it was an issue with the main water supply of the area and not the hotels issue. We called a bunch of times to see if this was resolved and got no proper update.  We left the hotel to go out and before coming back we called in the afternoon to get an update and the status was that the water issue was not yet resolved and nobody went to clean the room yet. In the evening around 10:30 we called again and the hotel staff assured us the room was checked and cleaned and the water issue was resolved.   We got back to the hotel and went back to our suite, the whole apartment had water soaked into the fitted carpet. When we went down to speak to the  management they said they would change our suite for us which they did but  ended up being in an apartment suite  that was in worse condition in terms of cleanliness than the first one we stayed in!   There was dust everywhere the room looked like it was not used in a long time. There was dust on the toilet area, there was dirt and crumbs on the carpet, dust on shelves, the bedding in all three rooms had dust and hair on them. According to the staff the suite had been ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù earlier in the day. We were surprised by how confident they were in claiming everything had been cleaned when clearly it was not!    It is now 1:30am and the staff are cleaning under our supervision! We are supposed to be on a relaxing holiday and instead this trip has been full of stress and irritation due to negligence by hotel staff and management. Their compensation to us was slippers and tissue boxes!!!   The attached photos speak for themselves even the hotel staff who came to move our luggage to the ‚Äúnewly prepared suite‚Äù were embarrassed to see such a dirty and disgusting apartment suite. All they could say is on ‚Äúbehalf of the hotel we are truly sorry tell us what we can do to make it better‚Äù.   Seriously???!!!!!!  This is supposed to be under ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù hotel chains and it was no where near the Hilton standard!  We are extremely shocked and frustrated and disappointed about everything we have been through and still have to stay until our. Checkout as  it is non refundable.‚Ä¶"

It was a - 0000. The hotel pictures were falsely depicted online. I DO NOT recommend any international travelers to stay at this hotel. I PROMISE you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it certainly does not meet Covid protocol. It was unsanitary and management  and overall customer service was the WORST. We rented a suite to accommodate my family. We checked in at 4am in the morning and the complaints began as soon as we walked in. We ended our stay there by 11am. Total of 6 hours of disgust and poor hospitality. My cousin was locked into one of the bedrooms and we had to call the front desk from our cell phones since our hotel room phone was not working. It took them an hour to break down the door and get him out. The couches and dinning room chairs were stained, the carpet was stained and had lifted from the floor. The kitchen was not cleaned the stove had not been cleaned from the previous stay and was rusted and old. A loud electrical noise was coming from the kitchen that they couldn‚Äôt resolve and it lasted the entire time. The bathrooms were SCUM. Not cleaned. Toilets were stained and we could see scum and mold forming in all three bathrooms. No toilet paper, no clean towels, no soap‚Ä¶. Complete mess. I had initially reserved 3 nights and that quickly changed to a few hours. The manger that was the least bit helpful. I kept talking to her in English and she would respond in Arabic. She said she would not give us a refund that we would need to call Hilton hotline to complain. Although Hilton had said that the hotel would need to directly refund me. The hotel mgr mentioned they will be closing their doors anyways for remodeling in the next coming months. And she also said that since I spent more than a few hours in the hotel that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them to refund me. RIDICULOUS. This hotel needs to be reported to the Tourism Authorities really. Egypt is a beautiful and wonderful country full of hospitality and history and the people are full of heart and kindness.

My husband and I are here for a few days prior to our Nile river cruise. Staff is extremely helpful at the dining areas, rooftop pool or just in the lobby areas. If you look confused they jump Right in to ask how they can assist you.   Restaurants - Middle eastern restaurant on the BR level was excellent - we had chicken soup, pigeons stuffed with rice etc. pigeons were a nice surprised with very dark meat but nicely spiced. E had a couple of tajines - but was way too much food for even the four of us.  SUGGESTION - Disclosing the portion size at ordering would help prevent food wastage. We felt bad at how much food we couldn‚Äôt eat. The restaurant on the R level was good for breakfast with representation of varied cultures. Ample types of food for people to decide what to eat. Pool bar - we came later in the day. Rooftop was clean with comfy lounges and couches. We had a couple of cocktails and some nibbles to watch the sun set.  Room COMFORTABLE BED! Slept really well. Soaker tub was appreciated and it helped me to wind down so I could sleep. Spacious bathroom. They stopped by and asked if we needed water.

But, the Wifi never worked, the Fitness Center, Rooftop Pool, and Terrace are out of operation, the Free Breakfast isn't international, and is the same every day. I suggest improving the cleanliness of the lobby & breakfast area, as well as the tobacco smell in the room (despite my room being for non-smoking people).  I highlight the room's cleanliness & comfort and the staff's friendliness."

First of all the room is neat and tidy.  Housekeeping team is doing a good job. And the receptionists are friendly and polite especially Mr. Rady.   The reason I rated this hotel 3/5 because, 1. The complimentary breakfast is same everyday and it‚Äôs not in international standard. The breakfast is not recommended for non-Egyptians.  2. There are 16 floors in this hotel and there is only one lift. You can imagine the wait time for the lift to come. Lift is always busy and we have to wait long to get the lift.  It‚Äôs better to stay in lower floor..  The lobby is not so clean as you can find lots of bees."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We were a bit nervous first time in Cairo a new city and new country how is everything going to be? But Ritz Carlton was amazing and gave us a great start to our holiday. I had corresponded with the hotel and requested for connecting rooms. On checkin due to my platinum elite status we were upgraded to connecting rooms facing the Nile, and free breakfast. The rooms were great, location was amazing and breakfast was great. My kids were really happy with all of it. We also got breakfast boxes packed for us. Starting our trip here kicked off our Egypt explorations to a great start. The forums have been so great and we used the Cairo airport shuttle which was seamless to be dropped off at the airport.  The front office staff was always great, especially Mahmoud who checked us in and  the location is really great.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We spent three amazing nights in the Ritz Carlton. We originally booked city executive suite and were upgraded to Superb Nile view. From the moment you step in you feel welcomed and the service was up to bar. The outstanding staff at the lounge did not reserve a minute to offer help and a very friendly atmosphere. It was so touching that when they realised our love for Mango they prepared a surprising Mango feast for us. It was very touching to us. Noise were not as bad as highlighted in many reviews after all we understand that we are living in the hustle and bustle of cairo city. Ritz Carlton Cairo is among the best I ever stayed in, in terms of pleasant smile and friendliness. I am afraid I might miss some names but every staff we met were top notch. Especially would like to thank Ossama and Asmaa from the lounge, the waiters team in the lounge and cleaning team in 12 floors who kept the room spotless. Thank you all.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"One of the best hotels in Egypt. Love the room, we got upgraded to Junior Suite and it was stunning room with 2 bathrooms and all the modern amenities.   Dinner at pool side restaurant was great! They had good small plates and vegetarian choices. Drinks were also well made.   Best thing was the breakfast. There executive chef came and talked to us personally. Overall I would recommend, little steep price for Egypt but worth it. "
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Undertrained staff some of which will stop to chat with coworkers while customer waits for spoon, ice, coffee ‚Ä¶ Some that just disappear leaving customer to request another to help. Example - told iced-tea is a special order.  While it is expected that people at local venues may not speak English, it is reasonable to expect staff at the concierge, reception and restaurant should be able to communicate in English.  COVID has left many businesses understaffed,  Ritz-Carlton should be able to procure more experienced employees or at least provide them with better training."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"From the reception at check in with Matthew who upgraded us (because we are Marriot Bonvoy Gold elite members) to a perfect room with a view of the Nile where we got to a stunning sunset every night, it was magical. All services from the restaurant and chamber maids, to the chic lounge with delicious desserts, we absolutely loved our stay. Down to the beds and bedding sheets, it was perfect. Thank you The Nile Ritz Carlton for a brilliant stay!! I highly recommended it!!"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Cairo direct on the Nile River and a stone throw away from the Egyptian National museum. Many great restaurants and bars are close by and easy reachable within a 5 minute taxi ride. The hotel, rooms and staff were exactly what we expected from a Ritz Carlton Hotel, just perfect."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger and longer Egypt trip. We'd certainly start off by saying what a perfect location this property is, right at Tahrir Square and the Egyptian Museum. It's so close as well to many of the hip restaurants around this side of the Nile. The hotel itself is well secured, and the moment you pass through the metal detectors into the lobby, you are greeted by a fantastic Guest Relations team and a wonderful public space on the ground floor. In fact, all of the public areas seem current, well maintained and appointed with everything you would need. However, once we got to the room the story was a little different: we had a junior-suite, overlooking Tahrir Square, and off the bat our A/C was not working properly (specifically, the thermostat was not functioning, no matter what we changed the temperature to there was no change). The room also had an older smell, maybe even a smokey smell that was apparent each time you would walk in. The bathroom were huge and very clean, but had older fixtures with discoloration. Much of the room had this, in fact, with some parts of the ceiling having dry wall cracking and leaving little white crumbs around. Did any of this inhibit our experience? Not really, as the service makes up for it. But it's not exactly what I'd expect from The Ritz-Carlton. I'd like to give a final shout-out to Mina Aziz from Guest Relations: he made sure every request we had was fulfilled and even helped make some special cases work for us. Any future visits to Cairo would still have us staying here over any other option.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Great location, very secure, wonderful people, the pool is lovely. The gym is large with treadmills, ellipticals, and a plethora of weights and machines. We love a large gym and I will add extra time in the morning for this one. The breakfast is a huge display of every option you could imagine. The lobby piano is a nice way to enjoy their treats. Having a bank on sight helps when getting out cash and change. Enjoy your stay"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"** POSITIVE ** Firstly the staff were almost excellent, majority of the time were very attentive and assisted with my needs.  Food was a decent spread of international/ local cuisine and promptly served     **NEGATIVE** Now the bad  - ROOM ALLOCATION  Despite me asking around 2/3 times at check-in to have a room away from noise and any events they put me in a room right beneath the top bar.  Consequently every night at around 2AM loud music would reverberate into my room to the sounds of Despacito.  As you can imagine I asked if I could be moved again 2/3 times where they would answer let me get back to you and nothing happened.  For a work trip this is really not acceptable.  Did I also mention as well we saw a mouse run across the lobby!  - THIRD PARTY CHAUFFER On Wednesday last week we hired a car from the hotel from the ‚ÄòMUSTANG COMPANY‚Äô.  I had forgot my wallet in the car getting out which I realised 2 min entering my room.  Upon receiving it back from the driver I noticed all the money had been taken out (USD/AED).  I spoke to the managers Mr Hossam/ Ahmed right away who informed me they would investigate to no avail.    Their rationale it‚Äôs a third party company where there is nothing they can do.  Whilst I understand it would be very hard to prove, this is the RITZ not a 2 star BNB and they should use reputable providers.  In my 14 years travelling for work I‚Äôve never had anything like this which is a real shame.  Its important to highlight the facts above in case there are any other travellers who have experienced the same.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1635921-Reviews-Swiss_Inn_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,They have party in the hotel almost everyday. You will not sleep before 23:00 o clock. The sound is so high that seems the party is in your room. No body told me about that. Such a disrespectful with the clients. And the party is from people outside the hotel! 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1635921-Reviews-Swiss_Inn_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Very old, dirty and smelly hotel in questionable location. Very busy traffic outside, lots of garbage, people loitering, unsafe to walk around. The hallway going to our room was full of cigarette smoke, it was disgusting! There was ash next to our bed. The shower was broken with most of the water coming from the shower spraying onto the wall. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1635921-Reviews-Swiss_Inn_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"By far one of the worst hotels I've been to in my life. There is a problem with the rooms and service staff. We had to change rooms twice, the first room was dirty, a peice of the sink fell off in the middle of the night scaring us, and some furniture was missing.   The second room was a nightmare, the bathroom stunk of sewer and rotten egg and the AC leaked like a waterfall. We complained about the AC the night it started leaking, then again the next morning, then again during the afternoon. In the afternoon, housekeeping came and put a bucket under the AC to fix the problem. After complaining for the 4th time, the maintenance guy came and hit the AC with a broom as it was his way of repairing it. Of course this strategy did not work and the AC started leaking again at 11PM. We called the reception and maintenance and they only showed up to our room at 11:35 PM after 4 phone calls. The maintenance guy requested the reception to change our room as fixing the AC would take a lot of time, they refused. The maintenance workers started using machinery to fix the AC as we were in the room.  Finally they changed our rooms to a better one at almost 1AM because I was crying hysterically in the reception from exhaustion because I had a morning flight the next day.   Oh and they left a full trash bag (that was not ours) in front of the room for an entire night.  Please save yourselves the trouble a book another hotel.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We (family of four) had made a reservation to stay for a night in Royal Galaxy Suites in early September 2018. The reservation was made over a month in advance. On the day when we arrived at the hotel, the receptionists stated that they had given the room to someone else as tried to debit the amount from the card but were unable to (this has never happened and I've used that card in over six countries including Egypt). They had sent a mail through booking.com to update card details but I was unable to access as I was traveling through the day.   They offered to send us to another hotel which was in a more remote part of town. When we arrived there, they stated that this would cost USD 90 instead of the USD 70 that was the original price. The rooms were of poor quality and they were just trying to take advantage of tourists who do not know the city well. We refused and moved out to find our own accommodation. They realized that we didn't take bait and within five minutes they sent the receptionist boy downstairs telling that the price was negotiable and that they would match the earlier price. However, we had decided to figure things out ourselves and walked out. These hotels use this as a business model to show fancy locations and rooms to customers and send you to another place (with a poorer quality) when you actually turn up. I also lost my faith in booking.com in allowing such hotels to operate. Never ever book in this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The first impression when you arrive is that the place looks old and not well maintained. they shouldn't call it an hotel, it can be considered as guest house. The rooms are not well maintained and old.  However, the location itself is nice and the view to whole cairo is amazing. in addition, the friendly staff is very strong additive that compensates the negative things i found in this place."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I would have rated this 3.5 stars if I could, as 4 stars I think is too much...but 0.5 is not an option, so 3 stars is enough. The best thing about this hotel is ofcourse the view, wich indeed is great, with the Nile and also the pyramids (if you book a room with this view). We had a very nice feeling to stay in the balcony and watch the sunset. Also, the staff is polite and helped me to order some food and drinks that we ate in the balcony. Also you can buy sheesha and smoke it in the balcony. The room was spacious and clean. On the other hand there are some negative aspects also. The hotel itself is just a part of a big building, so only the 38'th and 39'th floors are for the hotel. The elevator looked a little bit shabby...Although clean, in the bathroom was a strong smell like a shop full of plastic china stuff (it was from the shower courtain); not that big of a problem, but still.  There is no restaurant like they say (at least on booking.com), but just a room with some tables to eat. The breakfast was quite poor, an omlette and some gem and the kitchen looked not very clean. Also no towels changed or cleaning the room in the morning. And sound proof not good. The idiot next room waked us up at 3 AM in the night because he banged the door and talked loud on the balcony... Poor wifi in our room.  All in all, it was an ok stay, great view, but a little too expensive for what you get. We paid 110 euros for 2 nights on the room with nile and pyramids view; I think a fair price would have been around 70-80 euros.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This 3 star hotel we stayed in was for a night because our other hotel that we had booked in was not available for one night only dueing our trip, to cut it short the day of check out we had gone out in the morning to have breakfast and when we came back to check out we came to know that both of us friends who were in two different rooms had some money missing from our saftey box as we randomly counted them before leaving. Anyways the duty manager there did nothing to help he said that he checked the cameras in corridors and no one had entered our rooms. To cut it short my rooms safe box at my arrival was not working and when i asked the receptionist to get it fix he came with a box full of keys and had reset it and left and the sexond day this happened.  Even the taxi we had asked to pick us took us directly to the way to airport while we hadn‚Äôt told them too so when we asked him he is going to the wrong way he said that the guy at the hotel said you are going to the airport as i think they thought we are going back home to our country.  This is just a bad experience but definitely true as we both friends in different rooms got some money missing from our saftey box.  Please be careful thats is my message.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Excellent value for money. The hotel is located in the Zamalek district, in an area well connected to the points of interest of the city and at the same time a quiet area. the breakfast was good and with excellent pastries"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is in a good location and the room was clean, the bed comfortable. If you ask, you can get eggs cooked fresh for breakfast.  However, I requested a superior room because the room details stated that superior rooms have a balcony, and mine did not. This was very disappointing since this was the only reason I requested a superior room. Instead, it had a kitchenette which is strange and made it feel like a self contained apartment rather than a superior room in a hotel. I would have been better off with a regular room. Not long after I arrived, after waiting almost an hour past checkin time as the room was not ready, foul smelling water poured from an outlet under the sink, although I had not turned on the tap. The maintenance man did not listen when I explained where the water was coming from and that I had not turned on the tap, and instead fixed what would have been another problem had I done so, the broken pipe leading from the sink to the outlet above where the water came from. He also fixed a blockage which may have temporarily solved the mystery water issue. A young man came and carefully mopped the floor with antiseptic and clean water, but the smell lingered in the kitchenette for the duration of my stay, which fortunately was only one night.  When I went to have a shower I found the hot water was barely lukewarm, not matter how long I let the tap run for. There was no hot water in this room the entire stay.  Overall, it was overpriced for what I got, even for Zamalek.‚Ä¶"

The location of the hotel was perfect - there is a Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs in walking distance. There is a bank to exchange money nearby and lots of cute little cafes too. The area is really safe and we would often go out late in the evening and had no issues. Would definitely recommend staying here.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"There are more pros than cons about this little hotel. The location is fantastic and in the heart of Egypt‚Äôs finest neighborhood, Zamalek. Within a walking distance, you will find countless shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarkets and pharmacies. Literally everything you will ever need.  The hotel has some nice bars and restaurants. For a hotel this size, I was surprised they have some good options for a drink or a meal.  The room is small but very clean and you wouldn‚Äôt need it much if you are planning to move around.   Staff are generally very helpful and polite which is again something you might not find in 5-star hotels around Cairo.  Now when it comes to the cons of this hotel. It will be the elevator which is very slow and tiny so if the hotel is busy, you will suffer a bit.  Also, there‚Äôs no soundproofing system so you can hear everything happening next door but the managers were very supportive to control this.  I will definitely be staying here again.‚Ä¶"

They said okay no prob but there is a cancellation fee which is 122$, so If you want you can stay the night and pay the fee so you won‚Äôt lose it.  We stayed me and my friend, the second day they come and say we need 67$ more !!!  So basically the room is for 190$ (more than its own price) !!!!!!!!"

All, really all, hotel staff members were extremely friendly and helpful!! The breakfast on the rooftop terrace is lovely like ""in the middle"" of the muezzin sound and the rooms are furnished in a typical Cairo style. If you want to be in the middle of an everyday life in the old city and don't just love the American-international hotel chains, then this Riad is wonderful. Even going out of the hotel, late at night, just for a walk with our 12 and 21 year old kids, it totally was not dangerous in that area and interesting to see how life is going on and on during the night. But of course it is true, that the street noise goes on into the night, too and it is better to fall into bed very, very late yourself too for falling asleep tired....because the street noise goes on :-) . Nevertheless, as a family of 5 with teenage children, we found the hotel great for experiencing the feeling of Cairo's old town and we want to thank once more all the nice team of the Riad!!!‚Ä¶"

The rooms are very cozy decorated and every room has a own topic (beduine, belly dancer,..).  The restaurant on the roof was one of the best that we visit during our stay in Cairo.   It‚Äôs very loud in that street (especially in the nighttime). In front of the hotel is a coffee house where the people celebrate every day till 4am. Oropacks are useful!!"

If you are looking for an authentic Cairo experience away from the large hotels and typical tourist centers then this is your spot. We truly felt immersed in the authenticity of old Cairo, safe, and very welcome. The hospitality was above and beyond (Ahmed at the front desk was amazing!), the airport pickup was easy and seamless for our night time arrival, and the food at the rooftop restaurant was delicious (try the country breakfast!). The neighborhood was filled with historical sites, old Islamic Cairo‚Äôs captivating winding pedestrian streets, cafes, bazaars, restaurants, and endless charm. To top it off, each room is beautifully decorated in its own unique way. We stayed in the ‚ÄúCalligraphic‚Äù suite and the pictures really do not do it justice - large and clean modern bathroom, charming artwork and furniture, and a balcony overlooking the bustling streets below! The neighborhood is lively and can be a bit noisy but they provide earplugs which tuned it right out for us and I would not let this stop you from experiencing this truly unique and charming hotel with authentic Egyptian hospitality. We truly can‚Äôt wait to come back!‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This review is regarding day use at the Gabriel hotel pool.  I have been here more than 20 times for day use and ive spent the night 4 times and used to be a big fan. But since Andrew left its gone down the toilet. First of all we booked through the whatsapp booking. They asked for photo i.d of all my friends that wanted to come. Kind of ridiculous. Then they wanted all our facebook accounts. Presumably to check we dont look ugly or poor. Again ridiculous, this is a swimming pool not Studio 54. We are two couples in our 30s40s. We should not have to show a stupid social media presence to enter a pool. On arrival they told us that the reservation was to reserve attendance not to reserve sunbeds. That's not what a reservation is. So there were no umbrellas left and not enough sunbeds for our group (3 present and 2 joining later). There was one double bed left right next to the showers and speakers - least desirable spot. We asked for a spare sunbed to be bought over and put beside our bed as we are a group of 5. They refused. Said it was too difficult and just kept repeating ""no way"" because according to the obnoxious attendance the beds fit 7 people. The bed was the width of 3 pillows meaning if three people laid side by side like sardines they could fit, but not comfortably. I can guarantee no egyptian woman would be expected to be 7 to a sunbed but screw the white chicks they can suck it up? After an extended argument they put a sunbed next to the double bed which was no difficulty at all. We then asked for the spare umbrella but they refused saying the umbrellas that were ironically on wheels could not be moved. We had driven a long way so chose to stay, but without any shade we left after 3 hours. We would have liked to spend the day - the hottest day of the year so far. Its also important to mention that the dj blasts annoying house music too loud. They wont turn it down. This has been a problem on another visit when we were the only family at the pool and they still wouldnt turn it down a fraction. We couldn't talk  side by side without shouting.  Also on another visit when we had to be vetted on our facebook to make sure we were not scumbags there were people so ridiculously drunk they vomitted in the pool. We reported it to the waiter who went over to have a word and walked away with their drinks order! Its gotten gradually worse, but this visit really was the limit. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"First of all, this isn‚Äôt a 5 stars hotel!!!! It‚Äôs just a small hotel (arround 25 rooms) without buffet breakfast, broken cheap-fancy furniture, and minimum cleaning.   The hotel itself is a party for Egiptian people: starting in the pool (where you can‚Äôt simply relax because of the noise of ‚Äúthe music‚Äù - arabian reggeton‚Ä¶ later on the party continues in the ‚Äúrestaurant area‚Äù which is exactly in the middle of the hotel, so you can easily hear the excesively loud music from your room till very after the midnigth‚Ä¶  The breakfast is poor, and defficient quality. People attending the tables don‚Äôt speak english, and what you get isn‚Äôt frequently what you really ordered.  We choosed this hotel because of it‚Äôs nearby the airport, and it‚Äôs side by side to a big shopping mall (SunCity) which is mostly dead (5 floors and only very very few shops open).  Deffinetly I do not recommend this property unless you are looking for bad rest, egiptian partys all the time, bad food and a barely dead surrounding.  FAR, VERY FAR FROM A 5 STARS‚Ä¶ run away!‚Ä¶"

The minute We pulled up  to the property We were greeted at the car with the bell man waiting to collect our bags and guide us to the front desk. Izzy who works at the front desk, had everything ready and waiting for our arrival, she was 10 steps ahead lol and I can appreciate that. Thank you Izzy!! They try their best to accommodate your requests. 5/5 for customer service and staff. Cleanliness of the room 5/5 and comfort 5/5. Did not like that the bar was close for the nights we stayed there so that really was our only con about our stay. I definitely recommend the Gabriel, two thumbs up!"

It is in a very bad location, the view of the rooms are just not finished construction sites, it is beside a decadent shopping mall, far far away from the city. The room itself with stained bed linen, all the water from the faucets were dark brown, hairs in the pillows, stains in the carpet.  There was also a party in the main restaurant with loud music that we could listen in our rooms. Horrible!"

This excellent hotel is part of a Supermall in the up n coming section of ‚ÄúNew Cairo‚Äù. It allows some window shopping, as many stores are empty, where the affluent Egyptians partake and has an interesting food court if the two restaurants remain closed as during our stay.  15 minutes taxi from airport and an interesting location for those not interested in venturing into Cairo, it combines top notch service with an eclectic and curious ambiance. All the comforts and conveniences you have likely missed during your Egypt tour, await you here. We missed out on the restaurant review as it was closed for a private event (unusual) but the room service was excellent and delicious."

If you want to stay in same-same sterile modern international standard accommodation, you wouldn‚Äôt choose the Lotus Hotel. If, however, you seek old-world charm (without the fancy makeover that has arguably spoilt so many of the old-world hotels in Egypt), the Lotus is a really great choice. The rooms are simply furnished, very clean, & very adequate. The highlight of the hotel is the staff, who are wonderfully kind, helpful, welcoming, & 100% genuine in their care of their guests. The hotel is in a great downtown location, with plenty of local caf√©s, bars, restaurants, & shops in easy walking distance. I stayed at the Lotus on 3 occasions during my recent visit to Egypt.

As a single and first-time traveler to Cairo, it was the perfect place to stay for a week, and understand what daily life is like. I was able to walk to so many places once I felt confident with the rhythm of the streets (thanks to Samir Fayek). This place has so much character and warmth to share even if it's not a ""luxurious"" hotel. (Personally, I'm more interested in the depth and a story -- if you're looking for that, you will find it here. ) Ayman, Emad, Abeer, Ibrahim, and Adel (and others that I know I'm forgetting, sorry!) made me feel so welcome and couldn't have been more gracious. On my next trip to Egypt, no matter where I am, I will go out of my way to return to Lotus to say hello to everyone there. Mr. Wafik Doss (owner of the hotel) is a gem and a true professional in the world of hospitality, and I will continue to stay at his hotels in the future when I'm back in Cairo. Mr. Doss kindly introduced me to Mina and Samir Fayek (tour guide experts) that I highly recommend using if you're staying at Lotus or Windor. (They've been working together for ~40 years.) Wafik and the Fayek Tour Guides work from their hearts; I was lucky enough to experience it and will be forever grateful.‚Ä¶"

The hotel has been around some time, having survived the ups and downs of the tourism industry. It offers good value for money and the staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak English - some well. The beds are comfortable and the hotel gives a choice of western or Egyptian breakfast included in the very reasonable rates. I liked the manager very much and found him very helpful during the difficult 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. I almost had to stay on after the Cairo airport closed and would have felt safe there for weeks if that had happened. The hotel is well located too - close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum and many restaurants and other amenities."

It's a ten minute walk to the museum and plenty of eating options close by.  The hotel is an old time kind of place but I liked it. It had character.  The people who worked there also were friendly and and good banter. There is a bar upstairs where you can get a beer and chill out after the sightseeing during the day.  If any criticism maybe the breakfasts could be better. However for the price and the quality of the rooms ,mine with a balcony I found the place to my liking.  If I ever go back it will be there. Or possibly the Windsor hotel the one I should of been in which is the sister hotel closed for now. Keep up the good work guys.  We will return one day !!"

Also, the hotel may accept foreigners but it doesn't cater to them - forget about getting a drink of anything with alcohol in it, and forget about even getting a glass to your room if you plan to self-cater. The hotel only has plastic and paper disposable dixie cups ! They have no ice buckets and the best I could get was a plastic bag full - the place has no class of any kind.

Pros: Perfect location in the middle of Midan Tahrir with a magnificent view of the square from my room window  Friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping. Large room and electric kettle and bottled water supplied daily. The hotel is connected to La Poire one of Cairo's better known cafes.  Cons: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation with stained carpets. The bathroom leaked from both the sink and the shower. The drain in the shower didn't work and flooded the bathroom everytime I took a shower. Breakfast was basic and tasteless.  This hotel is not  cheap for the mediocre quality it offers  and  needs renovation soon. Just to add that the clientele was mainly Arab from various Arab countries with some Westerners and Africans.‚Ä¶

Aside from one person in the reception, the others were terrible. The one who greeted me in was unwelcoming. After taking my passport information and charging my card, he got a personal phone call and he stepped away leaving me there standing for several minutes without any information from the room or other. When he came back, he rudely said that the bellman would guide me to the room. Staff definitely needs urgent training on manners, politeness and being welcoming in general. Breakfast was terrible. Don't bother to book this hotel with breakfast (they offer a pre-packaged version that is not fresh at all). It is better to go to the small cafe place on the corner that provides excellent options."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The correct way to advertise Nile View hotel would be. Stay in a -5 star old rundown boat watching toxic waste dumping in the river. With an old rustic black mold infested carpet and mold in sink and shower and for entertainment staff entering your room late at night. And for a bonus get sick from the food and stay on the toilet looking at the Mold in the sink and shower. And for your safety in the event of an emergency there is a dirty old mattress in the hallway that you can hide under to keep you safe from predators. This is an experience of a lifetime. You can book this exciting holiday on Nile View deceptive website. Nile View hotels advertising is very misleading. It‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel it's a nothing star disgusting filthy old rundown boat that was so bad we both got very sick from the deplorable conditions. There is black mold everywhere in the carpet on the walls in the sink on the floors this was the most disgusting rundown hotel we have ever stayed at. And even the ceiling was falling apart. We witnessed hotel employees dumping toxic waste in the Nile. This hotel should not be allowed to be open as it is a health hazard. Our stay on the dirty old boat was a nightmare. Just read the numerous negative reviews and look at actual pictures posted by myself and others that stayed at Nile View they tell the truth. And no matter what lies Nile View post it does not change this fact ‚Ä¶

I enjoyed very much my stay with German group of 20 who nearly cancelled their booking from Feb, 28 till Mar. 02, 2020 only because we discovered that this great boat relocated in Maddi and still not open.  Instead, boat management was thoughtful enough to arrange for an A/C brand new shuttle bus dialy! First we thought this is only to & from the museum only. But we were mostly pleased to discover that this thoughtfulness extents to every where, any time and any numbers of time! Thoughtfulness is reflected in staff attitude as well! We and the owner are really lucky to have this staff who LOVE the boat, love their work and care soooooo much for customer satisfaction. I barely had the chance to order anything! They care enough to fullfil every need and any remark before you even say it!!  Nile view Zamalek (now Maadi): you made me proud, you made all the guests happy, you gave us such a wonderful experience that I want really to thank each and every one of you. I can't believe how caring, clean and kind every one of you are! It's not just hospitality it's true kindness & care coming from professional people who received us befoooooore getting readying and finishing innovations! But they really made a ""hard to please group"" ; feel home. Can't thank you enough, we will sure be back to see you after renovations After special entrance gate is finished. After sundeck and covered pool are ready  Food there is unforgettable! I had the most wonderful kabsa, the best hawawshy and an amaaaazing mixed grill. Breakfast buffet is memorable! Oh my God! What great bakery do they have!!! Best omlette in town! Tameya is fried before you. All kinds of hot drinks! Real fresh orange juice. Real care and morning smile. Even if you are in a hurry, they would notice and make you the best snacks to go! O my God after 2 days I'm still overwhelmed with your kindness people! I remember each and every name of you: Reception: Ahmed, Sheriff Mostafa & Adel. Room service: Refaat Food and beverage: Nabieh Omlette stand: Hamad (very caring) Chief at the kitchen is the best (not sure about the name) Even room cleaning: Maha Bill man. Security men who would help you park your car. Everyone .. I'm sorry I haven't met you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Can't wait till I'm back.‚Ä¶"

They just look at the rooms available when you check in and assign one of the available rooms to you. They just don‚Äôt care if the available room is not of the type you requested.  We reserved two rooms for 3 nights and requested that they should be next to each other. The hotel staff acknowledged and sent me an email with confirmation numbers. This happened 4 months before our stay. But still, when we checked in, they gave us rooms in two different sections of the hotel. Essam (not sure how it is spelt) was at the front desk and he was extremely uncooperative. He was adamant that those were the only rooms available even though our reservation was confirmed 4 months in advance. He finally told us that he would give us two adjacent rooms the next day.  But the next day, Essam did the same thing again. He reassigned rooms to us but in two different sections again. We argued with him again but it was of no use. This man would try strongly NOT to help customers. Fortunately for us, there was one more person at the front desk and he tried to help us. His name was Ahmed. After listening to our request, he found out that there were two adjacent rooms available on a different floor and he assigned them to us. Our request was finally accommodated. Our first positive experience at this hotel was with Ahmed.   I had another weird experience at this hotel. I went to the restaurant on the roof top one day. Instead of directing me to a table, the waiter asked me, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù. I then asked him, ‚ÄúDo you have vegetarian food?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhat is vegetarian food?‚Äù I was stunned! He was a waiter at a restaurant and he didn‚Äôt even know what vegetarian food was. This place is obviously run by weird guys.  The only other positive experience was with the staff at the breakfast.

Well I am glad that we stuck with our plan, the location is perfect, views of the Nile in the evening are stunning we ate all our meals for the two days we were there in the restaurant and we couldn't fault anything. The breakfast were really good as well with a large selection of fruits meats pastries etc. Yes the ""rooms"" are not big but they are cabins not rooms, this is a Nile Boat not a hotel! The rooms were clean and everything worked.The staff were all amazing and tried their best, there were a few language issues as this is not a tourist establishment but frequented mostly by local people. We were always made to feel most welcome by the other guests and even joined in the festivities of a birthday party and an engagement party. the only complain was yes there is a smell of cigarette smoke in corridors etc but the is Egypt there is no such thing as a non smoking area.Would go back there again.‚Ä¶"

The restaurant/bar at the pool wasn't great: they closed earlier than advertised and the drinks at the bar were awful. They don't know how to make a manhattan and the caipirinha was the worst i have ever had. Please also watch out: at check out, the desk person converted my Egyptian Pound invoice into USD and then proceeded to charge my credit card in GBP with a 4.5% markup without informing me. I pointed out to him that he was supposed to ask me in which currency i wanted to settle the bill, not decide for me. He tried to say that it was not him and that the machine automatically converted to GBP but i let him know that this was not teh first time i was checking out of a hotel with a credit card. Very dishonest and Unprofessional from a hotel of that standard. The 4.5% markup cost me an additional ¬£120.

There was nothing too big or small that they couldn‚Äôt accommodate. The concierge was amazing with helping us book all of the tours, excursions, travel we needed assistance  with. And when we needed to fly back early from a day trip to Luxor because one of our family members was having a health issue related to the extreme heat, they took care of all of the logistics.

The travel services to visit tourist spots provided by the Taxi booth of the hotel (named Last Minute travel services) was not up to the mark. The driver dropped me on the Egyptian museum and he was supposed to stay  at the gate. But when I come back visiting the museum, I did not find him. Then I called him and he declined the call. I sent him message , he responded sending message after half an hour without giving any specific time of coming. I was puzzled, waiting and waiting. Then I was thinking to hire another Taxi. Finally he came after more than an hour.   The services provided was also costly. I could hire a Taxi using the APP less than half price.  On the way back, it was planned to take me a super store for buying dry fruits. But  he did not took me to a right store. It was felt to me that he did it intentionally.‚Ä¶"

It is in a green area with plenty of villas, quiet and peaceful, a relief to busy and dusty Cairo. It is fournished Laura Ashley style, and makes you realy nostalgic. We hoped to enjoy one of the two swimming pools and take a last sunbeam, but in this time of the year the pools are both in the shadow. We took diner in the evening in the beautiful garden near the pool. The food was delicious, but they don't have a wine card. They don't serve alcoholic drinks, but customers are allowed to bring bottles from outside the hotel, we saw several regulars with their own bottle at the table. Minus was the next morning, as we had to take an early flight and our breakfast was included in the price, I agreed with the staff in the lobby that they would bring it in the room before our departure. Only they brought us to bags to take in the taxi, not very comfortable. We left the bags untouched for the taxi driver.‚Ä¶"

The hotel is in a very nice part of Cairo, hard to reconcile the lushness here with the normal Egyptian scenery of sand dunes and camels. There are various embassies and institutes nearby and a big police presence which was reassuring The hotel itself is a colonial residence and quaint. Certainly, very different from the chains. The ambience within is that of a boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I was very happy with my room and the amenities. My only quibble was the wi-fi and not particularly comfortable work conditions The outside seating area is lovely to sit out the sunset. The pool is small but nice, but is in the dining area, and so you have limited access if you are working, so I had to make sure to return early to make use of it. Many of the reviews mention the food.  Out of necessity I are there all 3 nights I stayed. I found the food to be mediocre. I later stayed in other hotels nearby and found some brilliant places to eat and regret I was not more adventurous when I stayed at the Belle Epoque If I was being a tourist and not working, I would certainly recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"

But I saw the mix bag of reviews for Belle Epoque, I felt the need to chime in.  I am not a big hotel kind of a traveler. So, when I booked the flights to Cairo, I started looking. This was the only (or the only nice looking) boutique hotel I found. Some friends warned me Egypt doesn't do boutique hotels well, and yes, the reviews freaked me out a bit. But I couldn't bring myself to book one of those chain hotels... so I took a gamble.  It paid off. Really paid of!  The neighborhood is tree-filled, lush green, relaxed and quiet residential area loved by embassies and posh locals. Lots of nice restaurants, cafes, shops within walking distance. Locals told me they walk everywhere in this neighborhood. Many also told me they often come to Belle Epoque  for the pool, or for lunch.  You may spend your day in the hustle bustle of busy chaotic Cairo doing tourists stuff, so why not pick the most laid back beautiful villa to go back to relax at night? I loved Cairo, and I am definitely coming back. And when I am coming back, I will definitely stay here again.  PS: beautifully decorated spacious rooms, nice and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"

The rest is a short essay about one of the best experiences I had in my life! My review is: 1920s Boutique Hotel is your ""home"" away from home. Professional and friendly staff, great service, lovely rooms, cozy place, positive and relaxing vibes, soft and comfy linen (Egyptian cotton I'm sure). If you're looking for a place where you want to be comfortable and at ease, this is the place for you. The noise coming from ground floor can be a bit overwhelming, but it didn't bother me whatsoever. All in all, I enjoyed the offering of the restaurants there. Great food!  For those who are willing to know a bit more, keep reading.  I requested special things in the room but I did not have any expectations ( I was only hoping). I was amazed, in fact I was shocked, gobsmacked when all my requests were met! The amazing John, Amir & Super Ramzi took the extra mile (perhaps ten extra miles) to make my requests happen!   I walked into that place as a guest, and I left as a friend! The best experience, ever! ‚Ä¶"

Rooms are above 3 nigh clubs. No sound insulation. High volume noise from the clubs. Noise from the reception. People screaming. Now it's 2.45 am, music still high.  Do not come here for sleeping.   Except this, kind staff and good general quality.  The picture is taken from the balcony of my room."

The ambiance is good infact amazing, you would love the vibe of the hotel and people are friendly, they will help you to feel comfortable.  Pros:  1. Ambiance is good 2. Bed & room sizes are good 3. Staff is friendly and helpful 4. Good restaurants inside the compound havng good variety  Cons: 1. Very very loud music will make your nights sleepless 2. Breakfast options are limited (though whatever they have is tasty but very limited) 3. No Amenities - in the name of gym they have one treadmill and a multi-machine thats it! 4. Weirdly, you need to ask for airport pickup/drop 48 hours early. Very very weird rule which is not mentioned anywhere. 5. TOO COSTLY - they are charging more than the nearby Le Meridien, without amenities (no swimming pool, no gym, no buffet breakfsat, wifi will not work most of the time, toileteries are of low standards)  Conclusion: Okay for a night or two, but looking at the price its absolutely no value for money. You can check Le Meridien, Holiday Inn, Intercontinental etc these are not far (under 3km from this place)  And yeah, while I was staying - one guest complained that he was robbed in the hotel, he lost his money from the room and he caught someone entering the room at midnight when he was sleeping. He took the picture of the person who entered his room. Hotel response was - "" The guy was there for housekeeping"". Who does housekeeping at midnight????‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d15467003-Reviews-1920s_Boutique_Hotel_and_Restaurants-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I was meeting a friend from Italy in Egypt for a weekend. She set up the reservation. Originally she booked the reservation through a third-party website and it was supposed to be just her but she extended the invitation to me via contacting the hotel via email letting them know that I would be joining her. We were to share a King Size room. I was traveling from the United States via 3 plane rides & 22.5 hours of travel. I had been emailing the hotel with the reservation and the information that I would be coming in earlier (1am) than my friend (3am) and I would love to get into the room sooner to relax, shower and get to bed as we were going to be waking up at 630 a.m. to do tours/see Egypt. I also inquired about getting picked up at the airport. They assured me they would send a driver, as they did. However when I arrived there were multiple problems, lack of communication, language barriers, Etc.. even though I showed them the emails Etc they would not let me check into the room. I decided to go to the attached bar restaurant to have a glass of wine & buy some bottled water (the hotel never offered me anything to drink while I was NOT planning on waiting over 2 hours for my friend to arrive), I was sooooo tired. I even tried to just pay for the entire room myself but there was no budging I talked with someone on the phone who spoke English and it was Still just beyond ridiculous.  They FINALLY let me into the room by 3am and my friend ended up arriving around 3:30 a.m..  Let's just say how exhausted I was the next day!!!  Other than that- here is the rest of my review. *The hotel location is great because there are four different restaurants that you can go back and forth in between right in the same area one of them Pincho's (Tapas) is actually attached to the hotel and was fabulous. *It is easy to grab an Uber or to take the metro one street over from the hotel. *The hotel is beautifully decorated & clean & they have an elevator, sauna, fitness room. *Air conditioning unit worked great, shower pressure and temperature we're perfect. *They have one large bottle of complimentary water, coffee, tea, sugar and sugar-free packets with a tea kettle, they had a nice complementary fresh fruit platter for us. They also have mini fridge with multiple items for a small charge, ie: water, beer, soda, etc. *The staff is very nice and was EXTREMELY Apologetic (but unfortunately I couldn't earn my sleep back). *The bed/mattress is okay but probably would bother my back if I stayed more then one night. Not firm enough. I checked in around 3am Saturday- FINALLY!!! and checked out Sunday 12noon. *The sheets are Horrible! They definitely are not good quality, the sheets and the comforter are all pilled! You would think Egyptian cotton sheets, right?!?! Lol! NOT! *They don't offer body lotion but do offer: shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bar soap, comb, shower cap, towels, toilet paper, bath towels, robes, slippers, etc.. So to sum up.... I would normally give this review a 3-star because of the problems that I encountered but the hotel in itself with what it had to offer, would give it a 5-star which is why my rating is just going to be at 4. IF the hotel were to upgrade the sheets/comforters, a better mattress & fix the communication breakdown (prepared knowledge beforehand) They would get a 5 star review from me. Would I stay here again?? Probably. There are more positives then negatives. Hope that helps.‚Ä¶"

He made multiple phone calls to the agency and made sure that the issue was resolved.  He was very pleasant and professional."

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!

No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301697-Reviews-Hilton_Cairo_Zamalek_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I think this Hilton is the best one in Cairo at the moment. They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶. I can recommend this hotel fully and can‚Äôt wait to return here.‚Ä¶"

The hotel lobby, coffee shop, outdoor pool and location were great. The morning buffet breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly and helpful.  However, the rooms are extremely old and dated. Additionally, they have not been maintained. On the first night, water from the bathroom above our room leaked and flooded our bathroom. The room balcony which had a fantastic view of the Nile was unusable as it hadn't been maintained and dirty.  I would still stay at this hotel due to the location, amenities and staff."

In the restaurant we were well taken care of by IMAN and the bell hop Ashfar made sure our Uber arrived on time and stayed with us until he arrived.

My husband and I are here for a few days prior to our Nile river cruise. Staff is extremely helpful at the dining areas, rooftop pool or just in the lobby areas. If you look confused they jump Right in to ask how they can assist you.   Restaurants - Middle eastern restaurant on the BR level was excellent - we had chicken soup, pigeons stuffed with rice etc. pigeons were a nice surprised with very dark meat but nicely spiced. E had a couple of tajines - but was way too much food for even the four of us.  SUGGESTION - Disclosing the portion size at ordering would help prevent food wastage. We felt bad at how much food we couldn‚Äôt eat. The restaurant on the R level was good for breakfast with representation of varied cultures. Ample types of food for people to decide what to eat. Pool bar - we came later in the day. Rooftop was clean with comfy lounges and couches. We had a couple of cocktails and some nibbles to watch the sun set.  Room COMFORTABLE BED! Slept really well. Soaker tub was appreciated and it helped me to wind down so I could sleep. Spacious bathroom. They stopped by and asked if we needed water. Appreciated  Maybe we can try the spa tomorrow‚Ä¶ Definitely would recommend!‚Ä¶"

I have addressed minor services concerns found within the first few hours of my hotel check-In to the receptionist, who addressed my service concerns to the GM of hotel, who then called all hotel directors and asked them to speak to me in person individually and all apologized and offered me some perks i.e. the restaurants, coffee shop, swimming pool, refund on stay fees, town tours fees, room services...etc.  In addition to this they continued to follow up with me to ensure all my needs were met and if I needed anything further.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d543043-Reviews-Cairo_World_Trade_Center_Hotel_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is by far THE worst ever. Everything was covered in dust in the room, we booked for a two week stay and unfortunately due to it being non refundable we had to live with the situation. Despite our daily complaints and reminders about how many guests are in the suite we never received the right amount of cutlery, the eggs were never cooked the way we asked which was simple ‚Äúwell done‚Äù it was always runny, the bathrooms were not clean at all, the balcony door would not shut completely, the window lock on one of the bedrooms would fall off as soon as we opened the window. These were not even the big issues.  We arrived on the 13th and today is the 22nd the water supply to the hotel was cut off. When we spoke to the staff/management they had claimed it was an issue with the main water supply of the area and not the hotels issue. We called a bunch of times to see if this was resolved and got no proper update.  We left the hotel to go out and before coming back we called in the afternoon to get an update and the status was that the water issue was not yet resolved and nobody went to clean the room yet. In the evening around 10:30 we called again and the hotel staff assured us the room was checked and cleaned and the water issue was resolved.   We got back to the hotel and went back to our suite, the whole apartment had water soaked into the fitted carpet. When we went down to speak to the  management they said they would change our suite for us which they did but  ended up being in an apartment suite  that was in worse condition in terms of cleanliness than the first one we stayed in!   There was dust everywhere the room looked like it was not used in a long time. There was dust on the toilet area, there was dirt and crumbs on the carpet, dust on shelves, the bedding in all three rooms had dust and hair on them. According to the staff the suite had been ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù earlier in the day. We were surprised by how confident they were in claiming everything had been cleaned when clearly it was not!    It is now 1:30am and the staff are cleaning under our supervision! We are supposed to be on a relaxing holiday and instead this trip has been full of stress and irritation due to negligence by hotel staff and management. Their compensation to us was slippers and tissue boxes!!!   The attached photos speak for themselves even the hotel staff who came to move our luggage to the ‚Äúnewly prepared suite‚Äù were embarrassed to see such a dirty and disgusting apartment suite. All they could say is on ‚Äúbehalf of the hotel we are truly sorry tell us what we can do to make it better‚Äù.   Seriously???!!!!!!  This is supposed to be under ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù hotel chains and it was no where near the Hilton standard!  We are extremely shocked and frustrated and disappointed about everything we have been through and still have to stay until our. Checkout as  it is non refundable.‚Ä¶"

It was a - 0000. The hotel pictures were falsely depicted online. I DO NOT recommend any international travelers to stay at this hotel. I PROMISE you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it certainly does not meet Covid protocol. It was unsanitary and management  and overall customer service was the WORST. We rented a suite to accommodate my family. We checked in at 4am in the morning and the complaints began as soon as we walked in. We ended our stay there by 11am. Total of 6 hours of disgust and poor hospitality. My cousin was locked into one of the bedrooms and we had to call the front desk from our cell phones since our hotel room phone was not working. It took them an hour to break down the door and get him out. The couches and dinning room chairs were stained, the carpet was stained and had lifted from the floor. The kitchen was not cleaned the stove had not been cleaned from the previous stay and was rusted and old. A loud electrical noise was coming from the kitchen that they couldn‚Äôt resolve and it lasted the entire time. The bathrooms were SCUM. Not cleaned. Toilets were stained and we could see scum and mold forming in all three bathrooms. No toilet paper, no clean towels, no soap‚Ä¶. Complete mess. I had initially reserved 3 nights and that quickly changed to a few hours. The manger that was the least bit helpful. I kept talking to her in English and she would respond in Arabic. She said she would not give us a refund that we would need to call Hilton hotline to complain. Although Hilton had said that the hotel would need to directly refund me. The hotel mgr mentioned they will be closing their doors anyways for remodeling in the next coming months. And she also said that since I spent more than a few hours in the hotel that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them to refund me. RIDICULOUS. This hotel needs to be reported to the Tourism Authorities really. Egypt is a beautiful and wonderful country full of hospitality and history and the people are full of heart and kindness. The hotel and management did not represent this country in any form or way. Shame on your Hilton World Trade.‚Ä¶"

The complimentary breakfast is same everyday and it‚Äôs not in international standard. The breakfast is not recommended for non-Egyptians.  2. There are 16 floors in this hotel and there is only one lift. You can imagine the wait time for the lift to come. Lift is always busy and we have to wait long to get the lift.  It‚Äôs better to stay in lower floor..  The lobby is not so clean as you can find lots of bees."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"If you live old world charm, this is the place. The bones are beautiful - a cage elevator, grand front doors,  worn marble steps, balconies, floor to ceiling windows. Lively,and very nicely decorated. Beds are good, great wifi and air con, and conveniently above shops that sell snack and cheap water. Also a great, walkable location (and easy to grab an Uber).  The glassed in bathrooms are a creative solution and quite lovely. But they are really only ideal for people who are okay seeing each other on the toilet. Maybe not for besties, or work colleagues, or your dad.  The arranged driver was lovely and waited when we were delayed at airport. And staff Wafaa deserves to be rewarded for her courtesy, attentiveness, and competence.    The only real downside, and the reason we only enjoyed 1 included breakfast, was being cornered for the hard-sell by owner Mustafa. He wanted to change our current plans and pressed us to go to his other property so he could redesign our whole trip. PUSHY. This was so annoying and rude that we have cancelled our plans to return to this hotel at the end of our trip. Just to avoid this dude. Really too bad.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is located very close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum, and a few other old downtown highlights. While the outside of the building looks slightly dilapidated--clearly beyond the control of the hotel--the entrance to the hotel and the interior is nicely done and inviting. Staff are very kind, helpful, and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and have the essentials. In the dining area, complementary tea and water are on offer throughout the day.  A few drawbacks: the street noise is very clearly heard from within the rooms (windows are not double paned), and Cairenes LOVE to honk for any and all reasons so you'll still feel very in touch with street life even within the hotel. Breakfast is rather mediocre: expect toast, hard boiled eggs, some jam, and a small cup of yoghurt, accompanied by tea or nescafe. The bedsheets are in serious need of updating (they are extremely rough and scratchy, making sleeping difficult). The bathrooms are an afterthought - just a corner in the room cordoned off by half-frosted glass, so it is recommended that you are very comfortable sharing all bodily functions with whomever you share the room. Despite a clear 'no smoking' sign at the front desk, staff still smoke in common areas (entry, dining area). We stayed in the room at the far end of the hallway (there are only six rooms) and could smell the smoke very clearly from inside our room with the door shut. When I went to pay for our room at checkout, one staff member sat directly in front of me smoking. I called him out on it, pointing at the 'no smoking' sign right in front of us, and he apologised profusely and moved away with his cigarette. I am 100% confident he resumed smoking inside as soon as we left.  Some of the basics aren't looked after: the room we were given had no pillowcases on three of our four pillows, and only one towel. The rest of the linens were out at the cleaners, and since there was only one person on staff, we had to stand in for the staff at the front desk so they could run out and pick up the clean linen. Rooms don't come with soap, but we were given a bottle of liquid soap when we asked. Early checkin is USD 25 on top of the regular room charge. The staff offered to arrange a car back to the airport on our departure, quoting a price double of what we paid to get from the airport to the hotel in the first place. It is recommended to just take an Uber instead (EGP 100-125, depending on traffic and time of day). Overall, it's not a bad hotel, and the staff's kindness goes a long way to compensate for the weaknesses noted above.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We arrived at the hotel around 10.30 am, too early for check-in. Luckily, our room-to-be had been vacated and the bathroom cleaned, so we could use it and head out for a walk. Thanks to Achmed and Mustafa for that.  But I do not understand why they needed another two hours to get the room ready, when they did not even join the beds as we had requested a double bed at the time of booking or keep any towels when we returned close to 13:00. There were only hand/face towels kept, and even on the second day when we asked for bath towels, we got one, and were reluctantly asked, 'Do you need one more, I'll have to get it from the laundry.' Not being sure if he meant washed or unwashed laundry, we let it pass, lol. The shower fluctuates between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the staff tried their best to get it to work but it didn't, even on the second day. Add to it the tiny glass enclosure which they call a bathroom, there's no room to escape the hot and cold water, I almost got burnt! The glass cubicle idea is very weird, the frosting on the glass could have been complete near the toilet area at least! We stayed two nights, and were given two small bottles of water on the first day. When we asked on the second day, we were told it would be charged! When you check-in to a room, the least you expect is a hot shower, towels and water to drink. Sadly these were missing. The Wifi didn't work either. A special shout out to the lady in-charge of the cafe (I think her name is Ms. Wafa), she was very sweet and very efficient. The room itself was furnished well, with a nice wardrobe ideal for long stays. The two-rating is purely for the location and staff, and well the elevator! Grand Agor probably needs to decide if they want to be a hotel or a hostel. They are right now priced like a hotel with amenities like a hostel. There are much better cheaper places to stay in the downtown area, for once the Tripadvisor reviews did not match my experience, and I regret staying here.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"With the relentless chaos in Cairo, it‚Äôs important that you have a peaceful place to rest your head after a long day of exploring the city.   The hotel itself is quite new, which is great as the staff are always looking for feedback. The double room was very spacious with a lovely looking bathroom - unfortunately the hot water wasn‚Äôt too consistent so the showers could have been better. The bed was very comfortable, and there was a TV bracket on the wall but no TV. Unfortunately the WiFi was experiencing some issues during our stay so we didn‚Äôt have a great connection.   The hotel staff are just lovely; breakfast each morning was (as others have said) made with love, and the lovely lady would always offer us a tea or coffee when we were around. She really couldn‚Äôt do enough to take care of the guests and was one of our favourite parts of the hotel.   The location is also great, and central enough that you can pop back to use the toilet/have a coffee/take a breather from the Cairo madness, at any point during the day.   We arranged hotel pick up with the hotel after struggling to get in touch with them. If you do the same, make sure you go outside to meet your driver as only police are allowed inside the airport. Price was 25USD return which is very reasonable.   If we visit Cairo again we would stay at the Grand Agor - definitely recommend it.   The hotel also arranges tours for guests - we took one to the pyramids which was 20USD for both of us. Definitely do this. Avoid he public transport. Giza is hectic and stressful enough without waiting around for a bus! ‚Ä¶"

First off, do not let the entrance to the building where the hotel is distract you, it looks rough at best, but once you are inside the hotel, it is very nice. The staff is the friendliest you can find anywhere in the world, the rooms are wide and comfortable and  you get a feeling like you are staying at your friends house, and not actually at a hotel. Plus its location is very very good, right in downtown, near the museum, metro station, stores, etc. Last but not least the lift is very peculiar, not only is it very peculiar on the way it operates, but has its own theme music when moving, I know this sounds very odd, and it is, but for us it added a very special touch.‚Ä¶"

Its prime location in downtown allowed us to move freely in the area by foot or by public transport. Local restaurants were 5 minutes away, so is the Egyptian museum. The staff is super welcoming, professional and helpful. Every morning, our breakfast was made with love, by the lovely caretaker- Mrs Ouafa. Also, our room was spacious and very comfortable. Overall, it was a very nice hotel where price and comfort meets on the same level. We would highly recommend to those who wish to stay abit local and avoid the massive hotel chains.   **the hotel is actually located on the 2nd floor, so don‚Äôt be afraid to use the old lift! It is part of the egyptian experience!**"

Good to stay.  The hotel is far from the city center, do shopping is not easy.  The travel services to visit tourist spots provided by the Taxi booth of the hotel (named Last Minute travel services) was not up to the mark. The driver dropped me on the Egyptian museum and he was supposed to stay  at the gate. But when I come back visiting the museum, I did not find him. Then I called him and he declined the call. I sent him message , he responded sending message after half an hour without giving any specific time of coming. I was puzzled, waiting and waiting. Then I was thinking to hire another Taxi. Finally he came after more than an hour.   The services provided was also costly. I could hire a Taxi using the APP less than half price.  On the way back, it was planned to take me a super store for buying dry fruits. But  he did not took me to a right store. It was felt to me that he did it intentionally.‚Ä¶"

But Ritz Carlton was amazing and gave us a great start to our holiday. I had corresponded with the hotel and requested for connecting rooms. On checkin due to my platinum elite status we were upgraded to connecting rooms facing the Nile, and free breakfast. The rooms were great, location was amazing and breakfast was great. My kids were really happy with all of it. We also got breakfast boxes packed for us. Starting our trip here kicked off our Egypt explorations to a great start. The forums have been so great and we used the Cairo airport shuttle which was seamless to be dropped off at the airport.  The front office staff was always great, especially Mahmoud who checked us in and  the location is really great.‚Ä¶"

We originally booked city executive suite and were upgraded to Superb Nile view. From the moment you step in you feel welcomed and the service was up to bar. The outstanding staff at the lounge did not reserve a minute to offer help and a very friendly atmosphere. It was so touching that when they realised our love for Mango they prepared a surprising Mango feast for us. It was very touching to us. Noise were not as bad as highlighted in many reviews after all we understand that we are living in the hustle and bustle of cairo city. Ritz Carlton Cairo is among the best I ever stayed in, in terms of pleasant smile and friendliness. I am afraid I might miss some names but every staff we met were top notch. Especially would like to thank Ossama and Asmaa from the lounge, the waiters team in the lounge and cleaning team in 12 floors who kept the room spotless. Thank you all.‚Ä¶"

Example - told iced-tea is a special order.  While it is expected that people at local venues may not speak English, it is reasonable to expect staff at the concierge, reception and restaurant should be able to communicate in English.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Cairo direct on the Nile River and a stone throw away from the Egyptian National museum. Many great restaurants and bars are close by and easy reachable within a 5 minute taxi ride. The hotel, rooms and staff were exactly what we expected from a Ritz Carlton Hotel, just perfect."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger and longer Egypt trip. We'd certainly start off by saying what a perfect location this property is, right at Tahrir Square and the Egyptian Museum. It's so close as well to many of the hip restaurants around this side of the Nile. The hotel itself is well secured, and the moment you pass through the metal detectors into the lobby, you are greeted by a fantastic Guest Relations team and a wonderful public space on the ground floor. In fact, all of the public areas seem current, well maintained and appointed with everything you would need. However, once we got to the room the story was a little different: we had a junior-suite, overlooking Tahrir Square, and off the bat our A/C was not working properly (specifically, the thermostat was not functioning, no matter what we changed the temperature to there was no change). The room also had an older smell, maybe even a smokey smell that was apparent each time you would walk in. The bathroom were huge and very clean, but had older fixtures with discoloration. Much of the room had this, in fact, with some parts of the ceiling having dry wall cracking and leaving little white crumbs around. Did any of this inhibit our experience? Not really, as the service makes up for it. But it's not exactly what I'd expect from The Ritz-Carlton. I'd like to give a final shout-out to Mina Aziz from Guest Relations: he made sure every request we had was fulfilled and even helped make some special cases work for us. Any future visits to Cairo would still have us staying here over any other option.‚Ä¶"

The gym is large with treadmills, ellipticals, and a plethora of weights and machines. We love a large gym and I will add extra time in the morning for this one. The breakfast is a huge display of every option you could imagine. The lobby piano is a nice way to enjoy their treats. Having a bank on sight helps when getting out cash and change. Enjoy your stay"

Food was a decent spread of international/ local cuisine and promptly served     **NEGATIVE** Now the bad  - ROOM ALLOCATION  Despite me asking around 2/3 times at check-in to have a room away from noise and any events they put me in a room right beneath the top bar.  Consequently every night at around 2AM loud music would reverberate into my room to the sounds of Despacito.  As you can imagine I asked if I could be moved again 2/3 times where they would answer let me get back to you and nothing happened.  For a work trip this is really not acceptable.  Did I also mention as well we saw a mouse run across the lobby!  - THIRD PARTY CHAUFFER On Wednesday last week we hired a car from the hotel from the ‚ÄòMUSTANG COMPANY‚Äô.  I had forgot my wallet in the car getting out which I realised 2 min entering my room.  Upon receiving it back from the driver I noticed all the money had been taken out (USD/AED).  I spoke to the managers Mr Hossam/ Ahmed right away who informed me they would investigate to no avail.    Their rationale it‚Äôs a third party company where there is nothing they can do.  Whilst I understand it would be very hard to prove, this is the RITZ not a 2 star BNB and they should use reputable providers.  In my 14 years travelling for work I‚Äôve never had anything like this which is a real shame.

We had to change rooms twice, the first room was dirty, a peice of the sink fell off in the middle of the night scaring us, and some furniture was missing.   The second room was a nightmare, the bathroom stunk of sewer and rotten egg and the AC leaked like a waterfall. We complained about the AC the night it started leaking, then again the next morning, then again during the afternoon. In the afternoon, housekeeping came and put a bucket under the AC to fix the problem. After complaining for the 4th time, the maintenance guy came and hit the AC with a broom as it was his way of repairing it. Of course this strategy did not work and the AC started leaking again at 11PM. We called the reception and maintenance and they only showed up to our room at 11:35 PM after 4 phone calls. The maintenance guy requested the reception to change our room as fixing the AC would take a lot of time, they refused. The maintenance workers started using machinery to fix the AC as we were in the room.  Finally they changed our rooms to a better one at almost 1AM because I was crying hysterically in the reception from exhaustion because I had a morning flight the next day.   Oh and they left a full trash bag (that was not ours) in front of the room for an entire night.  Please save yourselves the trouble a book another hotel.‚Ä¶"

It is in a green area with plenty of villas, quiet and peaceful, a relief to busy and dusty Cairo. It is fournished Laura Ashley style, and makes you realy nostalgic. We hoped to enjoy one of the two swimming pools and take a last sunbeam, but in this time of the year the pools are both in the shadow. We took diner in the evening in the beautiful garden near the pool. The food was delicious, but they don't have a wine card. They don't serve alcoholic drinks, but customers are allowed to bring bottles from outside the hotel, we saw several regulars with their own bottle at the table. Minus was the next morning, as we had to take an early flight and our breakfast was included in the price, I agreed with the staff in the lobby that they would bring it in the room before our departure. Only they brought us to bags to take in the taxi, not very comfortable. We left the bags untouched for the taxi driver.‚Ä¶"

Attention to detail in the design is matched by the attention to great customer service and delicious food. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and will definitely stay there again in the future.

We all selected from the Christmas menu and made our choices a few days before coming. The food was excellent and service really attentive without being obtrusive. I can highly recommend.

Everything is delicious, professionally served, you‚Äôre surrounded with greens and nice people ) I saw some nice vegan and vegetarian options at the menu, so definitely we‚Äôll return here again for dinner"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1722944-Reviews-Villa_Belle_Epoque-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I chose the hotel for the convenience to where I was going to be working. The hotel is in a very nice part of Cairo, hard to reconcile the lushness here with the normal Egyptian scenery of sand dunes and camels. There are various embassies and institutes nearby and a big police presence which was reassuring The hotel itself is a colonial residence and quaint. Certainly, very different from the chains. The ambience within is that of a boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I was very happy with my room and the amenities. My only quibble was the wi-fi and not particularly comfortable work conditions The outside seating area is lovely to sit out the sunset. The pool is small but nice, but is in the dining area, and so you have limited access if you are working, so I had to make sure to return early to make use of it. Many of the reviews mention the food.  Out of necessity I are there all 3 nights I stayed. I found the food to be mediocre. I later stayed in other hotels nearby and found some brilliant places to eat and regret I was not more adventurous when I stayed at the Belle Epoque If I was being a tourist and not working, I would certainly recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1722944-Reviews-Villa_Belle_Epoque-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I seldom write reviews. But I saw the mix bag of reviews for Belle Epoque, I felt the need to chime in.  I am not a big hotel kind of a traveler. So, when I booked the flights to Cairo, I started looking. This was the only (or the only nice looking) boutique hotel I found. Some friends warned me Egypt doesn't do boutique hotels well, and yes, the reviews freaked me out a bit. But I couldn't bring myself to book one of those chain hotels... so I took a gamble.  It paid off. Really paid of!  The neighborhood is tree-filled, lush green, relaxed and quiet residential area loved by embassies and posh locals. Lots of nice restaurants, cafes, shops within walking distance. Locals told me they walk everywhere in this neighborhood. Many also told me they often come to Belle Epoque  for the pool, or for lunch.  You may spend your day in the hustle bustle of busy chaotic Cairo doing tourists stuff, so why not pick the most laid back beautiful villa to go back to relax at night? I loved Cairo, and I am definitely coming back. And when I am coming back, I will definitely stay here again.  PS: beautifully decorated spacious rooms, nice and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We (family of four) had made a reservation to stay for a night in Royal Galaxy Suites in early September 2018. The reservation was made over a month in advance. On the day when we arrived at the hotel, the receptionists stated that they had given the room to someone else as tried to debit the amount from the card but were unable to (this has never happened and I've used that card in over six countries including Egypt). They had sent a mail through booking.com to update card details but I was unable to access as I was traveling through the day.   They offered to send us to another hotel which was in a more remote part of town. When we arrived there, they stated that this would cost USD 90 instead of the USD 70 that was the original price. The rooms were of poor quality and they were just trying to take advantage of tourists who do not know the city well. We refused and moved out to find our own accommodation. They realized that we didn't take bait and within five minutes they sent the receptionist boy downstairs telling that the price was negotiable and that they would match the earlier price. However, we had decided to figure things out ourselves and walked out. These hotels use this as a business model to show fancy locations and rooms to customers and send you to another place (with a poorer quality) when you actually turn up. I also lost my faith in booking.com in allowing such hotels to operate. Never ever book in this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The first impression when you arrive is that the place looks old and not well maintained. they shouldn't call it an hotel, it can be considered as guest house. The rooms are not well maintained and old.  However, the location itself is nice and the view to whole cairo is amazing. in addition, the friendly staff is very strong additive that compensates the negative things i found in this place."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I would have rated this 3.5 stars if I could, as 4 stars I think is too much...but 0.5 is not an option, so 3 stars is enough. The best thing about this hotel is ofcourse the view, wich indeed is great, with the Nile and also the pyramids (if you book a room with this view). We had a very nice feeling to stay in the balcony and watch the sunset. Also, the staff is polite and helped me to order some food and drinks that we ate in the balcony. Also you can buy sheesha and smoke it in the balcony. The room was spacious and clean. On the other hand there are some negative aspects also. The hotel itself is just a part of a big building, so only the 38'th and 39'th floors are for the hotel. The elevator looked a little bit shabby...Although clean, in the bathroom was a strong smell like a shop full of plastic china stuff (it was from the shower courtain); not that big of a problem, but still.  There is no restaurant like they say (at least on booking.com), but just a room with some tables to eat. The breakfast was quite poor, an omlette and some gem and the kitchen looked not very clean. Also no towels changed or cleaning the room in the morning. And sound proof not good. The idiot next room waked us up at 3 AM in the night because he banged the door and talked loud on the balcony... Poor wifi in our room.  All in all, it was an ok stay, great view, but a little too expensive for what you get. We paid 110 euros for 2 nights on the room with nile and pyramids view; I think a fair price would have been around 70-80 euros.‚Ä¶"

The staff and management at Havana are one of its strongest assets. Always super helpful, friendly and efficient. It‚Äôs location in Syria St in Mohandeseen is another draw card with so many fantastic shops and restaurants (I like the barber shops too, the best shave and haircut you can find!). The rooms and bathrooms are well above standard for a 3star hotel in my opinion. Good restaurant and shisha bar on site, licensed bar, and great coffee."

Anyways the duty manager there did nothing to help he said that he checked the cameras in corridors and no one had entered our rooms. To cut it short my rooms safe box at my arrival was not working and when i asked the receptionist to get it fix he came with a box full of keys and had reset it and left and the sexond day this happened.  Even the taxi we had asked to pick us took us directly to the way to airport while we hadn‚Äôt told them too so when we asked him he is going to the wrong way he said that the guy at the hotel said you are going to the airport as i think they thought we are going back home to our country.  This is just a bad experience but definitely true as we both friends in different rooms got some money missing from our saftey box.  Please be careful thats is my message.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is in a good location and the room was clean, the bed comfortable. If you ask, you can get eggs cooked fresh for breakfast.  However, I requested a superior room because the room details stated that superior rooms have a balcony, and mine did not. This was very disappointing since this was the only reason I requested a superior room. Instead, it had a kitchenette which is strange and made it feel like a self contained apartment rather than a superior room in a hotel. I would have been better off with a regular room. Not long after I arrived, after waiting almost an hour past checkin time as the room was not ready, foul smelling water poured from an outlet under the sink, although I had not turned on the tap. The maintenance man did not listen when I explained where the water was coming from and that I had not turned on the tap, and instead fixed what would have been another problem had I done so, the broken pipe leading from the sink to the outlet above where the water came from. He also fixed a blockage which may have temporarily solved the mystery water issue. A young man came and carefully mopped the floor with antiseptic and clean water, but the smell lingered in the kitchenette for the duration of my stay, which fortunately was only one night.  When I went to have a shower I found the hot water was barely lukewarm, not matter how long I let the tap run for. There was no hot water in this room the entire stay.  Overall, it was overpriced for what I got, even for Zamalek.‚Ä¶"

The location of the hotel was perfect - there is a Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs in walking distance. There is a bank to exchange money nearby and lots of cute little cafes too. The area is really safe and we would often go out late in the evening and had no issues. Would definitely recommend staying here.

The location is fantastic and in the heart of Egypt‚Äôs finest neighborhood, Zamalek. Within a walking distance, you will find countless shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarkets and pharmacies. Literally everything you will ever need.  The hotel has some nice bars and restaurants. For a hotel this size, I was surprised they have some good options for a drink or a meal.  The room is small but very clean and you wouldn‚Äôt need it much if you are planning to move around.   Staff are generally very helpful and polite which is again something you might not find in 5-star hotels around Cairo.  Now when it comes to the cons of this hotel. It will be the elevator which is very slow and tiny so if the hotel is busy, you will suffer a bit.  Also, there‚Äôs no soundproofing system so you can hear everything happening next door but the managers were very supportive to control this.  I will definitely be staying here again.‚Ä¶"

They said okay no prob but there is a cancellation fee which is 122$, so If you want you can stay the night and pay the fee so you won‚Äôt lose it.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This review is regarding day use at the Gabriel hotel pool.  I have been here more than 20 times for day use and ive spent the night 4 times and used to be a big fan. But since Andrew left its gone down the toilet. First of all we booked through the whatsapp booking. They asked for photo i.d of all my friends that wanted to come. Kind of ridiculous. Then they wanted all our facebook accounts. Presumably to check we dont look ugly or poor. Again ridiculous, this is a swimming pool not Studio 54. We are two couples in our 30s40s. We should not have to show a stupid social media presence to enter a pool. On arrival they told us that the reservation was to reserve attendance not to reserve sunbeds. That's not what a reservation is. So there were no umbrellas left and not enough sunbeds for our group (3 present and 2 joining later). There was one double bed left right next to the showers and speakers - least desirable spot. We asked for a spare sunbed to be bought over and put beside our bed as we are a group of 5. They refused. Said it was too difficult and just kept repeating ""no way"" because according to the obnoxious attendance the beds fit 7 people. The bed was the width of 3 pillows meaning if three people laid side by side like sardines they could fit, but not comfortably. I can guarantee no egyptian woman would be expected to be 7 to a sunbed but screw the white chicks they can suck it up? After an extended argument they put a sunbed next to the double bed which was no difficulty at all. We then asked for the spare umbrella but they refused saying the umbrellas that were ironically on wheels could not be moved. We had driven a long way so chose to stay, but without any shade we left after 3 hours. We would have liked to spend the day - the hottest day of the year so far. Its also important to mention that the dj blasts annoying house music too loud. They wont turn it down. This has been a problem on another visit when we were the only family at the pool and they still wouldnt turn it down a fraction. We couldn't talk  side by side without shouting.  Also on another visit when we had to be vetted on our facebook to make sure we were not scumbags there were people so ridiculously drunk they vomitted in the pool. We reported it to the waiter who went over to have a word and walked away with their drinks order! Its gotten gradually worse, but this visit really was the limit. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.‚Ä¶"

It‚Äôs just a small hotel (arround 25 rooms) without buffet breakfast, broken cheap-fancy furniture, and minimum cleaning.   The hotel itself is a party for Egiptian people: starting in the pool (where you can‚Äôt simply relax because of the noise of ‚Äúthe music‚Äù - arabian reggeton‚Ä¶ later on the party continues in the ‚Äúrestaurant area‚Äù which is exactly in the middle of the hotel, so you can easily hear the excesively loud music from your room till very after the midnigth‚Ä¶  The breakfast is poor, and defficient quality. People attending the tables don‚Äôt speak english, and what you get isn‚Äôt frequently what you really ordered.  We choosed this hotel because of it‚Äôs nearby the airport, and it‚Äôs side by side to a big shopping mall (SunCity) which is mostly dead (5 floors and only very very few shops open).  Deffinetly I do not recommend this property unless you are looking for bad rest, egiptian partys all the time, bad food and a barely dead surrounding.  FAR, VERY FAR FROM A 5 STARS‚Ä¶ run away!‚Ä¶"

The minute We pulled up  to the property We were greeted at the car with the bell man waiting to collect our bags and guide us to the front desk. Izzy who works at the front desk, had everything ready and waiting for our arrival, she was 10 steps ahead lol and I can appreciate that. Thank you Izzy!! They try their best to accommodate your requests. 5/5 for customer service and staff. Cleanliness of the room 5/5 and comfort 5/5. Did not like that the bar was close for the nights we stayed there so that really was our only con about our stay. I definitely recommend the Gabriel, two thumbs up!"

This excellent hotel is part of a Supermall in the up n coming section of ‚ÄúNew Cairo‚Äù. It allows some window shopping, as many stores are empty, where the affluent Egyptians partake and has an interesting food court if the two restaurants remain closed as during our stay.  15 minutes taxi from airport and an interesting location for those not interested in venturing into Cairo, it combines top notch service with an eclectic and curious ambiance. All the comforts and conveniences you have likely missed during your Egypt tour, await you here. We missed out on the restaurant review as it was closed for a private event (unusual) but the room service was excellent and delicious."

If you want to stay in same-same sterile modern international standard accommodation, you wouldn‚Äôt choose the Lotus Hotel. If, however, you seek old-world charm (without the fancy makeover that has arguably spoilt so many of the old-world hotels in Egypt), the Lotus is a really great choice. The rooms are simply furnished, very clean, & very adequate. The highlight of the hotel is the staff, who are wonderfully kind, helpful, welcoming, & 100% genuine in their care of their guests. The hotel is in a great downtown location, with plenty of local caf√©s, bars, restaurants, & shops in easy walking distance. I stayed at the Lotus on 3 occasions during my recent visit to Egypt.

As a single and first-time traveler to Cairo, it was the perfect place to stay for a week, and understand what daily life is like. I was able to walk to so many places once I felt confident with the rhythm of the streets (thanks to Samir Fayek). This place has so much character and warmth to share even if it's not a ""luxurious"" hotel. (Personally, I'm more interested in the depth and a story -- if you're looking for that, you will find it here. ) Ayman, Emad, Abeer, Ibrahim, and Adel (and others that I know I'm forgetting, sorry!) made me feel so welcome and couldn't have been more gracious. On my next trip to Egypt, no matter where I am, I will go out of my way to return to Lotus to say hello to everyone there. Mr. Wafik Doss (owner of the hotel) is a gem and a true professional in the world of hospitality, and I will continue to stay at his hotels in the future when I'm back in Cairo. Mr. Doss kindly introduced me to Mina and Samir Fayek (tour guide experts) that I highly recommend using if you're staying at Lotus or Windor. (They've been working together for ~40 years.) Wafik and the Fayek Tour Guides work from their hearts; I was lucky enough to experience it and will be forever grateful.‚Ä¶"

It offers good value for money and the staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak English - some well.

I liked the manager very much and found him very helpful during the difficult 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. I almost had to stay on after the Cairo airport closed and would have felt safe there for weeks if that had happened.

It's a ten minute walk to the museum and plenty of eating options close by.  The hotel is an old time kind of place but I liked it. It had character.  The people who worked there also were friendly and and good banter. There is a bar upstairs where you can get a beer and chill out after the sightseeing during the day.  If any criticism maybe the breakfasts could be better. However for the price and the quality of the rooms ,mine with a balcony I found the place to my liking.  If I ever go back it will be there.

The hotel only has plastic and paper disposable dixie cups ! They have no ice buckets and the best I could get was a plastic bag full - the place has no class of any kind.

Pros: Perfect location in the middle of Midan Tahrir with a magnificent view of the square from my room window  Friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping. Large room and electric kettle and bottled water supplied daily. The hotel is connected to La Poire one of Cairo's better known cafes.  Cons: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation with stained carpets. The bathroom leaked from both the sink and the shower. The drain in the shower didn't work and flooded the bathroom everytime I took a shower. Breakfast was basic and tasteless.  This hotel is not  cheap for the mediocre quality it offers  and  needs renovation soon.

Aside from one person in the reception, the others were terrible. The one who greeted me in was unwelcoming. After taking my passport information and charging my card, he got a personal phone call and he stepped away leaving me there standing for several minutes without any information from the room or other. When he came back, he rudely said that the bellman would guide me to the room. Staff definitely needs urgent training on manners, politeness and being welcoming in general. Breakfast was terrible. Don't bother to book this hotel with breakfast (they offer a pre-packaged version that is not fresh at all). It is better to go to the small cafe place on the corner that provides excellent options."

Friendly staff, who - I have to say- do not expect tips every time they serve you (which is very rare in Egypt)   Mediocre hotel: -Breakfast is very good -Rooms are ok if you don‚Äôt mind to sleep on firm mattresses -Pillows are not the best -Towels are very rough and scratchy  -I found a hair on one of a shampoo bottles from a previous customer - No hair conditioner - No slippers - Spacious dated rooms - Clean, but not spotless - Bathroom has mold  - Room keys have to be replaced every time you close your room and go out. And every time I get to the hotel at night, I go first to the reception to make sure I have access to my room. It‚Äôs not only me who had this issue! The entire group I‚Äôm with suffered from not working keys. - taxis and Uber know the hotel well.. so no hassle getting back to the hotel -Internet not good if you plan to work or make video calls. It‚Äôs only ok for sending messages or requesting an Uber   Luckily, I can sleep in noise, but for those of you who need quietness to sleep, stay away  ‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The correct way to advertise Nile View hotel would be. Stay in a -5 star old rundown boat watching toxic waste dumping in the river. With an old rustic black mold infested carpet and mold in sink and shower and for entertainment staff entering your room late at night. And for a bonus get sick from the food and stay on the toilet looking at the Mold in the sink and shower. And for your safety in the event of an emergency there is a dirty old mattress in the hallway that you can hide under to keep you safe from predators. This is an experience of a lifetime. You can book this exciting holiday on Nile View deceptive website. Nile View hotels advertising is very misleading. It‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel it's a nothing star disgusting filthy old rundown boat that was so bad we both got very sick from the deplorable conditions. There is black mold everywhere in the carpet on the walls in the sink on the floors this was the most disgusting rundown hotel we have ever stayed at. And even the ceiling was falling apart. We witnessed hotel employees dumping toxic waste in the Nile. This hotel should not be allowed to be open as it is a health hazard. Our stay on the dirty old boat was a nightmare. Just read the numerous negative reviews and look at actual pictures posted by myself and others that stayed at Nile View they tell the truth.

I enjoyed very much my stay with German group of 20 who nearly cancelled their booking from Feb, 28 till Mar. 02, 2020 only because we discovered that this great boat relocated in Maddi and still not open.  Instead, boat management was thoughtful enough to arrange for an A/C brand new shuttle bus dialy! First we thought this is only to & from the museum only. But we were mostly pleased to discover that this thoughtfulness extents to every where, any time and any numbers of time! Thoughtfulness is reflected in staff attitude as well! We and the owner are really lucky to have this staff who LOVE the boat, love their work and care soooooo much for customer satisfaction. I barely had the chance to order anything! They care enough to fullfil every need and any remark before you even say it!!  Nile view Zamalek (now Maadi): you made me proud, you made all the guests happy, you gave us such a wonderful experience that I want really to thank each and every one of you. I can't believe how caring, clean and kind every one of you are! It's not just hospitality it's true kindness & care coming from professional people who received us befoooooore getting readying and finishing innovations! But they really made a ""hard to please group"" ; feel home. Can't thank you enough, we will sure be back to see you after renovations After special entrance gate is finished. After sundeck and covered pool are ready  Food there is unforgettable! I had the most wonderful kabsa, the best hawawshy and an amaaaazing mixed grill. Breakfast buffet is memorable! Oh my God! What great bakery do they have!!! Best omlette in town! Tameya is fried before you. All kinds of hot drinks! Real fresh orange juice. Real care and morning smile. Even if you are in a hurry, they would notice and make you the best snacks to go! O my God after 2 days I'm still overwhelmed with your kindness people! I remember each and every name of you: Reception: Ahmed, Sheriff Mostafa & Adel. Room service: Refaat Food and beverage: Nabieh Omlette stand: Hamad (very caring) Chief at the kitchen is the best (not sure about the name) Even room cleaning: Maha Bill man.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Please note that this hotel would not keep any rooms for you even after they confirm you that a room (or rooms) is reserved for you. They just look at the rooms available when you check in and assign one of the available rooms to you. They just don‚Äôt care if the available room is not of the type you requested.  We reserved two rooms for 3 nights and requested that they should be next to each other. The hotel staff acknowledged and sent me an email with confirmation numbers. This happened 4 months before our stay. But still, when we checked in, they gave us rooms in two different sections of the hotel. Essam (not sure how it is spelt) was at the front desk and he was extremely uncooperative. He was adamant that those were the only rooms available even though our reservation was confirmed 4 months in advance. He finally told us that he would give us two adjacent rooms the next day.  But the next day, Essam did the same thing again. He reassigned rooms to us but in two different sections again. We argued with him again but it was of no use. This man would try strongly NOT to help customers. Fortunately for us, there was one more person at the front desk and he tried to help us. His name was Ahmed. After listening to our request, he found out that there were two adjacent rooms available on a different floor and he assigned them to us. Our request was finally accommodated. Our first positive experience at this hotel was with Ahmed.   I had another weird experience at this hotel. I went to the restaurant on the roof top one day. Instead of directing me to a table, the waiter asked me, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù. I then asked him, ‚ÄúDo you have vegetarian food?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhat is vegetarian food?‚Äù I was stunned! He was a waiter at a restaurant and he didn‚Äôt even know what vegetarian food was. This place is obviously run by weird guys.  The only other positive experience was with the staff at the breakfast.

The breakfast were really good as well with a large selection of fruits meats pastries etc. Yes the ""rooms"" are not big but they are cabins not rooms, this is a Nile Boat not a hotel! The rooms were clean and everything worked.The staff were all amazing and tried their best, there were a few language issues as this is not a tourist establishment but frequented mostly by local people. We were always made to feel most welcome by the other guests and even joined in the festivities of a birthday party and an engagement party. the only complain was yes there is a smell of cigarette smoke in corridors etc but the is Egypt there is no such thing as a non smoking area.Would go back there again.‚Ä¶"

It was fully stocked with plenty of bottles of water, and there was a bouquet of roses with a hand-written note along with some welcome snacks, and a personalized dessert congratulating me for a recent accomplishment.  Soon after getting settled in, there was a knock on the door and my personal butler came in to introduce himself to me, and inform me of the services he was able to provide to me.

The restaurant/bar at the pool wasn't great: they closed earlier than advertised and the drinks at the bar were awful. They don't know how to make a manhattan and the caipirinha was the worst i have ever had. Please also watch out: at check out, the desk person converted my Egyptian Pound invoice into USD and then proceeded to charge my credit card in GBP with a 4.5% markup without informing me. I pointed out to him that he was supposed to ask me in which currency i wanted to settle the bill, not decide for me. He tried to say that it was not him and that the machine automatically converted to GBP but i let him know that this was not teh first time i was checking out of a hotel with a credit card. Very dishonest and Unprofessional from a hotel of that standard. The 4.5% markup cost me an additional ¬£120.

There was nothing too big or small that they couldn‚Äôt accommodate. The concierge was amazing with helping us book all of the tours, excursions, travel we needed assistance  with. And when we needed to fly back early from a day trip to Luxor because one of our family members was having a health issue related to the extreme heat, they took care of all of the logistics.  Cairo is a very overwhelming city that can have significant language and cultural barriers to the North American traveller and the FS Cairo Nile is there to help navigate and make sure your trip is amazing.

There are heaps of great places to eat close by the hotel and the staff can offer suggestions on where to try.  The included breakfast was basic but adequate.  The included wi-fi was a bit hit and miss but this was the same all over Egypt.  The staff were professional and friendly.  They had offered us free pick up from the airport but unfortunately when we arrived there was no one there to meet us.  Apparently they organised it for the wrong time.  We booked a tour of Giza through them for a reasonable price.  All in all we were happy with the service provided and would stay here again.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1799808-Reviews-Traveler_s_House_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We had a 3-day stay at this hostel after reading many great reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel staff were knowledgeable about the area and were able to recommend some favourite local restaurants. I wasn't too keen on having a shared bathroom, but the rooms with a private bathroom were sold out when we booked.  The room was clean and simple when we arrived. There was an armoire for us to store our clothing. The A/C had a bucket to collect drips underneath, but this was never a problem. There were two shared bathrooms to use and they were kept clean and stocked with toilet paper. During our stay, we never had issues with the bathrooms being occupied when we needed them. The common room has books to borrow, and satellite TV, but no A/C. Despite our room overlooking a busy street (during Ramadan), we didn't find the noise to be too loud. Unlimited fresh towels were provided, and Wifi is free (and signal strength good) in all rooms.  You can't beat the hotel location. It is so central that you don't need a taxi to visit the shopping district (July 26th street and Ataba Market), many restaurants, and several attractions (Tahrir Square, Museum, Nile Corniche). The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ramses Train Station which was very convenient for us.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1799808-Reviews-Traveler_s_House_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"For the low budget, this hostel is very good. Their rooms and bathrooms are basic and also clean.  The owner and his staffs are all good people to talk to. And they are willing to help and give advice on anything relating to having a good time in Cairo or Egypt.  They can arrange airport transfers and if you book atleast a certain number of nights, you will get a free transfer.   Location wise is in downtown, busy area and don't have to worry about safety late at night as the area is always filled with people. You can hear traffic from the room, so prepare earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  There are lots of restaurants to eat at and there is a confectionery right opposite the hostel.  I got a free upgrade to a room with 4 beds and attached bathroom despite booking for single bed shared bathroom.  In all, I recommend this hostel for budget travellers.‚Ä¶"

The host Adel and the staff Jasmine are super kind and helpful.  Jasmine is not just a worker there but becomes one of my best foreign friends, she took me to the famous traditional Koshary restaurant and even cooked for me the night before I left.    This is not a high-class hotel, but definitely a warm place if you want to make some friends and take rest.  The location is also very nice, you can easily grab the best dessert downstairs because the best El Abd is just across the street from travelers house.  It only takes around 10-15 mins by walk to the museum as well.  The only thing I would expect more is that they can refinish the room if they plan to make something different.  Some of the furnitures and facilities are not quite new.  But for a backpacker like me, this is still a nice place to stay.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1799808-Reviews-Traveler_s_House_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I booked this hostel based on reviews, and for once i was disappointed I have stayed in hostels before and have had better experiences  Pros Free wifi Great staff Centrally located Great communication via email Free airport pick up one way Price  Cons You enter the hostel via an old run down building in downtown The hostel has to be accessed by an old lift We had an ensuite room, there was a depression in the floor of the room, which was a hint of structural issues Peeling plaster off walls The bedsheets had holes in them The room was unclean, carpets dirty Bathroom unclean, no toilet paper either  We spent a few hours and rebooked another hotel. We explained to the staff that it was not personal and they said the cleaning lady had not been for a few days and they could sort out the cleaning for us. This hostel has great potential if they can sort out these issues‚Ä¶"

The staff treats their guests not only like guests but also like friends. They speak good English and can help you with everything (sightseeing tips, tours ...) You can always have a seat in the  ""living room"" and share your interests with other people. The hostel is in the center of down town and you can reach everything easily by taxi or metro.  Don't hesitate to ask for what ever you need, they will help you in any case. Adel, Yasmin, Maghed, Sam ... Thank you for everything, I'll definitely come back ! "

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!

No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.

THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "

It was an amazing experience, very friendly, hospitable , comfortable, efficient! The breakfast was fantastic ; views from rooms of either the Nile or Tahrir square were simply magnificent!  The luggages , check ins, check outs of ALL 57 of us were handled seemlessly by GATE 1 ! The buses were new, with WIFI and charge ports in every seat !

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!  Final Question? ‚Ä¶.. why is the same sandwich served three different ways in three days ‚Ä¶ the F&B director needs to question why standards are not being followed‚Ä¶"

No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.   The ambassador club is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen, out of all the intercontinentales I‚Äôve visited. Only the one in Seoul is of the same caliber.

THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶.

Additionally, they have not been maintained. On the first night, water from the bathroom above our room leaked and flooded our bathroom. The room balcony which had a fantastic view of the Nile was unusable as it hadn't been maintained and dirty.  I would still stay at this hotel due to the location, amenities and staff."

Special thanks to Amr at Concierge, he was truly superb. Looked after us the whole stay. Arranged all our travel arrangements each morning and had our room upgraded when we had a small issue. He even went as far as calling the hotel we were booked at in sharm el sheikh to arrange for them to send a car to the airport to collect us as our transfer had failed. It seemed nothing was too much trouble. If you stay here please introduce yourselves to Amr as if there is anything that you need he will assist with a smile. You are a great ambassador for Conrad, thank you again Amr."

The attention to detail throughout the hotel was fantastic. The housekeeping staff that was responsible for my room Saber and Laila were perfect and just a pleasure to see and talk to everyday. Very kind and helpful always asking if there was anything they could do for me. The hotel is in a great location and has amazing views. They have multiple restaurants, a bar/club, and a casino. I always felt welcomed and safe at the hotel. I will definitely stay here again if I should ever visit Cairo again in the future. "

Ahmed Abdelhady was our breakfast waiter and could not have been more helpful. It felt as though we were the only people in the restaurant when in fact he was able to give everyone in the restaurant personal and excellent service. We certainly appreciated the friendly attention he gave us ensuring all our needs and more were met.

House keeping were always supporting and not late on our requests although they were many.   Thanks for Mr. Khalil from the swimming area for always setting up nice lounges in the shade close to each other as we were 10 people.   Room dining has improved significantly over the years. We ordered burger and chicken nuggets on multiple occasions. Always fresh with quality meat/ chicken. What you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

I have addressed minor services concerns found within the first few hours of my hotel check-In to the receptionist, who addressed my service concerns to the GM of hotel, who then called all hotel directors and asked them to speak to me in person individually and all apologized and offered me some perks i.e. the restaurants, coffee shop, swimming pool, refund on stay fees, town tours fees, room services...etc.  In addition to this they continued to follow up with me to ensure all my needs were met and if I needed anything further.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d543043-Reviews-Cairo_World_Trade_Center_Hotel_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is by far THE worst ever. Everything was covered in dust in the room, we booked for a two week stay and unfortunately due to it being non refundable we had to live with the situation. Despite our daily complaints and reminders about how many guests are in the suite we never received the right amount of cutlery, the eggs were never cooked the way we asked which was simple ‚Äúwell done‚Äù it was always runny, the bathrooms were not clean at all, the balcony door would not shut completely, the window lock on one of the bedrooms would fall off as soon as we opened the window. These were not even the big issues.  We arrived on the 13th and today is the 22nd the water supply to the hotel was cut off. When we spoke to the staff/management they had claimed it was an issue with the main water supply of the area and not the hotels issue. We called a bunch of times to see if this was resolved and got no proper update.  We left the hotel to go out and before coming back we called in the afternoon to get an update and the status was that the water issue was not yet resolved and nobody went to clean the room yet. In the evening around 10:30 we called again and the hotel staff assured us the room was checked and cleaned and the water issue was resolved.   We got back to the hotel and went back to our suite, the whole apartment had water soaked into the fitted carpet. When we went down to speak to the  management they said they would change our suite for us which they did but  ended up being in an apartment suite  that was in worse condition in terms of cleanliness than the first one we stayed in!   There was dust everywhere the room looked like it was not used in a long time. There was dust on the toilet area, there was dirt and crumbs on the carpet, dust on shelves, the bedding in all three rooms had dust and hair on them. According to the staff the suite had been ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù earlier in the day. We were surprised by how confident they were in claiming everything had been cleaned when clearly it was not!    It is now 1:30am and the staff are cleaning under our supervision! We are supposed to be on a relaxing holiday and instead this trip has been full of stress and irritation due to negligence by hotel staff and management. Their compensation to us was slippers and tissue boxes!!!   The attached photos speak for themselves even the hotel staff who came to move our luggage to the ‚Äúnewly prepared suite‚Äù were embarrassed to see such a dirty and disgusting apartment suite. All they could say is on ‚Äúbehalf of the hotel we are truly sorry tell us what we can do to make it better‚Äù.   Seriously???!!!!!!  This is supposed to be under ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù hotel chains and it was no where near the Hilton standard!  We are extremely shocked and frustrated and disappointed about everything we have been through and still have to stay until our. Checkout as  it is non refundable.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d543043-Reviews-Cairo_World_Trade_Center_Hotel_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This hotel should have not been rated a 4 star . It was a - 0000. The hotel pictures were falsely depicted online. I DO NOT recommend any international travelers to stay at this hotel. I PROMISE you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it certainly does not meet Covid protocol. It was unsanitary and management  and overall customer service was the WORST. We rented a suite to accommodate my family. We checked in at 4am in the morning and the complaints began as soon as we walked in. We ended our stay there by 11am. Total of 6 hours of disgust and poor hospitality. My cousin was locked into one of the bedrooms and we had to call the front desk from our cell phones since our hotel room phone was not working. It took them an hour to break down the door and get him out. The couches and dinning room chairs were stained, the carpet was stained and had lifted from the floor. The kitchen was not cleaned the stove had not been cleaned from the previous stay and was rusted and old. A loud electrical noise was coming from the kitchen that they couldn‚Äôt resolve and it lasted the entire time. The bathrooms were SCUM. Not cleaned. Toilets were stained and we could see scum and mold forming in all three bathrooms. No toilet paper, no clean towels, no soap‚Ä¶. Complete mess. I had initially reserved 3 nights and that quickly changed to a few hours. The manger that was the least bit helpful. I kept talking to her in English and she would respond in Arabic. She said she would not give us a refund that we would need to call Hilton hotline to complain. Although Hilton had said that the hotel would need to directly refund me. The hotel mgr mentioned they will be closing their doors anyways for remodeling in the next coming months. And she also said that since I spent more than a few hours in the hotel that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them to refund me. RIDICULOUS. This hotel needs to be reported to the Tourism Authorities really. Egypt is a beautiful and wonderful country full of hospitality and history and the people are full of heart and kindness. The hotel and management did not represent this country in any form or way. Shame on your Hilton World Trade.‚Ä¶"

My husband and I are here for a few days prior to our Nile river cruise. Staff is extremely helpful at the dining areas, rooftop pool or just in the lobby areas. If you look confused they jump Right in to ask how they can assist you.   Restaurants - Middle eastern restaurant on the BR level was excellent - we had chicken soup, pigeons stuffed with rice etc. pigeons were a nice surprised with very dark meat but nicely spiced. E had a couple of tajines - but was way too much food for even the four of us.  SUGGESTION - Disclosing the portion size at ordering would help prevent food wastage. We felt bad at how much food we couldn‚Äôt eat. The restaurant on the R level was good for breakfast with representation of varied cultures. Ample types of food for people to decide what to eat. Pool bar - we came later in the day. Rooftop was clean with comfy lounges and couches. We had a couple of cocktails and some nibbles to watch the sun set.  Room COMFORTABLE BED! Slept really well. Soaker tub was appreciated and it helped me to wind down so I could sleep. Spacious bathroom. They stopped by and asked if we needed water.

The complimentary breakfast is same everyday and it‚Äôs not in international standard. The breakfast is not recommended for non-Egyptians.  2. There are 16 floors in this hotel and there is only one lift. You can imagine the wait time for the lift to come. Lift is always busy and we have to wait long to get the lift.

Good to stay.  The hotel is far from the city center, do shopping is not easy.  The travel services to visit tourist spots provided by the Taxi booth of the hotel (named Last Minute travel services) was not up to the mark. The driver dropped me on the Egyptian museum and he was supposed to stay  at the gate. But when I come back visiting the museum, I did not find him. Then I called him and he declined the call. I sent him message , he responded sending message after half an hour without giving any specific time of coming. I was puzzled, waiting and waiting. Then I was thinking to hire another Taxi. Finally he came after more than an hour.   The services provided was also costly. I could hire a Taxi using the APP less than half price.

But Ritz Carlton was amazing and gave us a great start to our holiday. I had corresponded with the hotel and requested for connecting rooms. On checkin due to my platinum elite status we were upgraded to connecting rooms facing the Nile, and free breakfast. The rooms were great, location was amazing and breakfast was great. My kids were really happy with all of it. We also got breakfast boxes packed for us. Starting our trip here kicked off our Egypt explorations to a great start. The forums have been so great and we used the Cairo airport shuttle which was seamless to be dropped off at the airport.

We originally booked city executive suite and were upgraded to Superb Nile view. From the moment you step in you feel welcomed and the service was up to bar. The outstanding staff at the lounge did not reserve a minute to offer help and a very friendly atmosphere. It was so touching that when they realised our love for Mango they prepared a surprising Mango feast for us. It was very touching to us. Noise were not as bad as highlighted in many reviews after all we understand that we are living in the hustle and bustle of cairo city. Ritz Carlton Cairo is among the best I ever stayed in, in terms of pleasant smile and friendliness. I am afraid I might miss some names but every staff we met were top notch.

Example - told iced-tea is a special order.  While it is expected that people at local venues may not speak English, it is reasonable to expect staff at the concierge, reception and restaurant should be able to communicate in English.

Many great restaurants and bars are close by and easy reachable within a 5 minute taxi ride. The hotel, rooms and staff were exactly what we expected from a Ritz Carlton Hotel, just perfect."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger and longer Egypt trip. We'd certainly start off by saying what a perfect location this property is, right at Tahrir Square and the Egyptian Museum. It's so close as well to many of the hip restaurants around this side of the Nile. The hotel itself is well secured, and the moment you pass through the metal detectors into the lobby, you are greeted by a fantastic Guest Relations team and a wonderful public space on the ground floor. In fact, all of the public areas seem current, well maintained and appointed with everything you would need. However, once we got to the room the story was a little different: we had a junior-suite, overlooking Tahrir Square, and off the bat our A/C was not working properly (specifically, the thermostat was not functioning, no matter what we changed the temperature to there was no change). The room also had an older smell, maybe even a smokey smell that was apparent each time you would walk in. The bathroom were huge and very clean, but had older fixtures with discoloration. Much of the room had this, in fact, with some parts of the ceiling having dry wall cracking and leaving little white crumbs around. Did any of this inhibit our experience? Not really, as the service makes up for it. But it's not exactly what I'd expect from The Ritz-Carlton. I'd like to give a final shout-out to Mina Aziz from Guest Relations: he made sure every request we had was fulfilled and even helped make some special cases work for us. Any future visits to Cairo would still have us staying here over any other option.‚Ä¶"

The gym is large with treadmills, ellipticals, and a plethora of weights and machines. We love a large gym and I will add extra time in the morning for this one. The breakfast is a huge display of every option you could imagine. The lobby piano is a nice way to enjoy their treats. Having a bank on sight helps when getting out cash and change. Enjoy your stay"

Food was a decent spread of international/ local cuisine and promptly served     **NEGATIVE** Now the bad  - ROOM ALLOCATION  Despite me asking around 2/3 times at check-in to have a room away from noise and any events they put me in a room right beneath the top bar.  Consequently every night at around 2AM loud music would reverberate into my room to the sounds of Despacito.  As you can imagine I asked if I could be moved again 2/3 times where they would answer let me get back to you and nothing happened.  For a work trip this is really not acceptable.  Did I also mention as well we saw a mouse run across the lobby!  - THIRD PARTY CHAUFFER On Wednesday last week we hired a car from the hotel from the ‚ÄòMUSTANG COMPANY‚Äô.  I had forgot my wallet in the car getting out which I realised 2 min entering my room.  Upon receiving it back from the driver I noticed all the money had been taken out (USD/AED).  I spoke to the managers Mr Hossam/ Ahmed right away who informed me they would investigate to no avail.    Their rationale it‚Äôs a third party company where there is nothing they can do.  Whilst I understand it would be very hard to prove, this is the RITZ not a 2 star BNB and they should use reputable providers.  In my 14 years travelling for work I‚Äôve never had anything like this which is a real shame.  Its important to highlight the facts above in case there are any other travellers who have experienced the same.‚Ä¶"

There is a problem with the rooms and service staff. We had to change rooms twice, the first room was dirty, a peice of the sink fell off in the middle of the night scaring us, and some furniture was missing.   The second room was a nightmare, the bathroom stunk of sewer and rotten egg and the AC leaked like a waterfall. We complained about the AC the night it started leaking, then again the next morning, then again during the afternoon. In the afternoon, housekeeping came and put a bucket under the AC to fix the problem. After complaining for the 4th time, the maintenance guy came and hit the AC with a broom as it was his way of repairing it. Of course this strategy did not work and the AC started leaking again at 11PM. We called the reception and maintenance and they only showed up to our room at 11:35 PM after 4 phone calls. The maintenance guy requested the reception to change our room as fixing the AC would take a lot of time, they refused. The maintenance workers started using machinery to fix the AC as we were in the room.  Finally they changed our rooms to a better one at almost 1AM because I was crying hysterically in the reception from exhaustion because I had a morning flight the next day.   Oh and they left a full trash bag (that was not ours) in front of the room for an entire night.  Please save yourselves the trouble a book another hotel.‚Ä¶"

We hoped to enjoy one of the two swimming pools and take a last sunbeam, but in this time of the year the pools are both in the shadow. We took diner in the evening in the beautiful garden near the pool. The food was delicious, but they don't have a wine card. They don't serve alcoholic drinks, but customers are allowed to bring bottles from outside the hotel, we saw several regulars with their own bottle at the table. Minus was the next morning, as we had to take an early flight and our breakfast was included in the price, I agreed with the staff in the lobby that they would bring it in the room before our departure.

The hotel is in a very nice part of Cairo, hard to reconcile the lushness here with the normal Egyptian scenery of sand dunes and camels. There are various embassies and institutes nearby and a big police presence which was reassuring The hotel itself is a colonial residence and quaint. Certainly, very different from the chains. The ambience within is that of a boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I was very happy with my room and the amenities. My only quibble was the wi-fi and not particularly comfortable work conditions The outside seating area is lovely to sit out the sunset. The pool is small but nice, but is in the dining area, and so you have limited access if you are working, so I had to make sure to return early to make use of it. Many of the reviews mention the food.  Out of necessity I are there all 3 nights I stayed. I found the food to be mediocre. I later stayed in other hotels nearby and found some brilliant places to eat and regret I was not more adventurous when I stayed at the Belle Epoque If I was being a tourist and not working, I would certainly recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"

But I saw the mix bag of reviews for Belle Epoque, I felt the need to chime in.  I am not a big hotel kind of a traveler. So, when I booked the flights to Cairo, I started looking. This was the only (or the only nice looking) boutique hotel I found. Some friends warned me Egypt doesn't do boutique hotels well, and yes, the reviews freaked me out a bit. But I couldn't bring myself to book one of those chain hotels... so I took a gamble.  It paid off. Really paid of!  The neighborhood is tree-filled, lush green, relaxed and quiet residential area loved by embassies and posh locals. Lots of nice restaurants, cafes, shops within walking distance. Locals told me they walk everywhere in this neighborhood. Many also told me they often come to Belle Epoque  for the pool, or for lunch.  You may spend your day in the hustle bustle of busy chaotic Cairo doing tourists stuff, so why not pick the most laid back beautiful villa to go back to relax at night? I loved Cairo, and I am definitely coming back. And when I am coming back, I will definitely stay here again.  PS: beautifully decorated spacious rooms, nice and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"

The area is also high class so local Egyptians will dine here. Possibly the best food I have eaten in Egypt!"

Reception service is outstanding even if breakfast is average, but you have heaps of space when booking a suite (2 bedrooms, each with an ensuite bathroom) + 1 lounge, all air conditioned, at an outstanding value for long term stays. I stayed with a friend during 15 days and we valued the genuine kindness of the owners! Book without thinking twice...."

Excellent Nile and Pyramids views from the room. Very spacious rooms with lounge and kitchen.  Beds were comfortable.  All the fixtures may not be perfect but the staff is very helpful and courteous. Hearty breakfast with the best Flafalls was included in our stay. The hotel very kindly oranised our pick up from the airport and organised an excursion  at a competitive price.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We (family of four) had made a reservation to stay for a night in Royal Galaxy Suites in early September 2018. The reservation was made over a month in advance. On the day when we arrived at the hotel, the receptionists stated that they had given the room to someone else as tried to debit the amount from the card but were unable to (this has never happened and I've used that card in over six countries including Egypt). They had sent a mail through booking.com to update card details but I was unable to access as I was traveling through the day.   They offered to send us to another hotel which was in a more remote part of town. When we arrived there, they stated that this would cost USD 90 instead of the USD 70 that was the original price. The rooms were of poor quality and they were just trying to take advantage of tourists who do not know the city well. We refused and moved out to find our own accommodation. They realized that we didn't take bait and within five minutes they sent the receptionist boy downstairs telling that the price was negotiable and that they would match the earlier price. However, we had decided to figure things out ourselves and walked out. These hotels use this as a business model to show fancy locations and rooms to customers and send you to another place (with a poorer quality) when you actually turn up. I also lost my faith in booking.com in allowing such hotels to operate. Never ever book in this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The first impression when you arrive is that the place looks old and not well maintained. they shouldn't call it an hotel, it can be considered as guest house. The rooms are not well maintained and old.  However, the location itself is nice and the view to whole cairo is amazing. in addition, the friendly staff is very strong additive that compensates the negative things i found in this place."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I would have rated this 3.5 stars if I could, as 4 stars I think is too much...but 0.5 is not an option, so 3 stars is enough. The best thing about this hotel is ofcourse the view, wich indeed is great, with the Nile and also the pyramids (if you book a room with this view). We had a very nice feeling to stay in the balcony and watch the sunset. Also, the staff is polite and helped me to order some food and drinks that we ate in the balcony. Also you can buy sheesha and smoke it in the balcony. The room was spacious and clean. On the other hand there are some negative aspects also. The hotel itself is just a part of a big building, so only the 38'th and 39'th floors are for the hotel. The elevator looked a little bit shabby...Although clean, in the bathroom was a strong smell like a shop full of plastic china stuff (it was from the shower courtain); not that big of a problem, but still.  There is no restaurant like they say (at least on booking.com), but just a room with some tables to eat. The breakfast was quite poor, an omlette and some gem and the kitchen looked not very clean. Also no towels changed or cleaning the room in the morning. And sound proof not good. The idiot next room waked us up at 3 AM in the night because he banged the door and talked loud on the balcony... Poor wifi in our room.  All in all, it was an ok stay, great view, but a little too expensive for what you get. We paid 110 euros for 2 nights on the room with nile and pyramids view; I think a fair price would have been around 70-80 euros.‚Ä¶"

Anyways the duty manager there did nothing to help he said that he checked the cameras in corridors and no one had entered our rooms. To cut it short my rooms safe box at my arrival was not working and when i asked the receptionist to get it fix he came with a box full of keys and had reset it and left and the sexond day this happened.  Even the taxi we had asked to pick us took us directly to the way to airport while we hadn‚Äôt told them too so when we asked him he is going to the wrong way he said that the guy at the hotel said you are going to the airport as i think they thought we are going back home to our country.  This is just a bad experience but definitely true as we both friends in different rooms got some money missing from our saftey box.  Please be careful thats is my message.‚Ä¶"

Instead, it had a kitchenette which is strange and made it feel like a self contained apartment rather than a superior room in a hotel. I would have been better off with a regular room. Not long after I arrived, after waiting almost an hour past checkin time as the room was not ready, foul smelling water poured from an outlet under the sink, although I had not turned on the tap. The maintenance man did not listen when I explained where the water was coming from and that I had not turned on the tap, and instead fixed what would have been another problem had I done so, the broken pipe leading from the sink to the outlet above where the water came from. He also fixed a blockage which may have temporarily solved the mystery water issue. A young man came and carefully mopped the floor with antiseptic and clean water, but the smell lingered in the kitchenette for the duration of my stay, which fortunately was only one night.  When I went to have a shower I found the hot water was barely lukewarm, not matter how long I let the tap run for. There was no hot water in this room the entire stay.  Overall, it was overpriced for what I got, even for Zamalek.‚Ä¶"

The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was also really clean. The staff were so friendly and kind and went out of their way to help us with everything. The location of the hotel was perfect - there is a Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs in walking distance. There is a bank to exchange money nearby and lots of cute little cafes too. The area is really safe and we would often go out late in the evening and had no issues. Would definitely recommend staying here.

The location is fantastic and in the heart of Egypt‚Äôs finest neighborhood, Zamalek. Within a walking distance, you will find countless shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarkets and pharmacies. Literally everything you will ever need.  The hotel has some nice bars and restaurants. For a hotel this size, I was surprised they have some good options for a drink or a meal.  The room is small but very clean and you wouldn‚Äôt need it much if you are planning to move around.   Staff are generally very helpful and polite which is again something you might not find in 5-star hotels around Cairo.  Now when it comes to the cons of this hotel. It will be the elevator which is very slow and tiny so if the hotel is busy, you will suffer a bit.  Also, there‚Äôs no soundproofing system so you can hear everything happening next door but the managers were very supportive to control this.  I will definitely be staying here again.‚Ä¶"

Booked at this hotel for 3 nights, when I reached the hotel and saw how small and normal the room is for such fee, I went directly to the reception and told them I wanna cancel the reservation cz It‚Äôs not what I expected. They said okay no prob but there is a cancellation fee which is 122$, so If you want you can stay the night and pay the fee so you won‚Äôt lose it.  We stayed me and my friend, the second day they come and say we need 67$ more !!!  So basically the room is for 190$ (more than its own price) !!!!!!!!"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This review is regarding day use at the Gabriel hotel pool.  I have been here more than 20 times for day use and ive spent the night 4 times and used to be a big fan. But since Andrew left its gone down the toilet. First of all we booked through the whatsapp booking. They asked for photo i.d of all my friends that wanted to come. Kind of ridiculous. Then they wanted all our facebook accounts. Presumably to check we dont look ugly or poor. Again ridiculous, this is a swimming pool not Studio 54. We are two couples in our 30s40s. We should not have to show a stupid social media presence to enter a pool. On arrival they told us that the reservation was to reserve attendance not to reserve sunbeds. That's not what a reservation is. So there were no umbrellas left and not enough sunbeds for our group (3 present and 2 joining later). There was one double bed left right next to the showers and speakers - least desirable spot. We asked for a spare sunbed to be bought over and put beside our bed as we are a group of 5. They refused. Said it was too difficult and just kept repeating ""no way"" because according to the obnoxious attendance the beds fit 7 people. The bed was the width of 3 pillows meaning if three people laid side by side like sardines they could fit, but not comfortably. I can guarantee no egyptian woman would be expected to be 7 to a sunbed but screw the white chicks they can suck it up? After an extended argument they put a sunbed next to the double bed which was no difficulty at all. We then asked for the spare umbrella but they refused saying the umbrellas that were ironically on wheels could not be moved. We had driven a long way so chose to stay, but without any shade we left after 3 hours. We would have liked to spend the day - the hottest day of the year so far. Its also important to mention that the dj blasts annoying house music too loud. They wont turn it down. This has been a problem on another visit when we were the only family at the pool and they still wouldnt turn it down a fraction. We couldn't talk  side by side without shouting.  Also on another visit when we had to be vetted on our facebook to make sure we were not scumbags there were people so ridiculously drunk they vomitted in the pool. We reported it to the waiter who went over to have a word and walked away with their drinks order! Its gotten gradually worse, but this visit really was the limit. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.‚Ä¶"

It‚Äôs just a small hotel (arround 25 rooms) without buffet breakfast, broken cheap-fancy furniture, and minimum cleaning.   The hotel itself is a party for Egiptian people: starting in the pool (where you can‚Äôt simply relax because of the noise of ‚Äúthe music‚Äù - arabian reggeton‚Ä¶ later on the party continues in the ‚Äúrestaurant area‚Äù which is exactly in the middle of the hotel, so you can easily hear the excesively loud music from your room till very after the midnigth‚Ä¶  The breakfast is poor, and defficient quality. People attending the tables don‚Äôt speak english, and what you get isn‚Äôt frequently what you really ordered.  We choosed this hotel because of it‚Äôs nearby the airport, and it‚Äôs side by side to a big shopping mall (SunCity) which is mostly dead (5 floors and only very very few shops open).

The minute We pulled up  to the property We were greeted at the car with the bell man waiting to collect our bags and guide us to the front desk. Izzy who works at the front desk, had everything ready and waiting for our arrival, she was 10 steps ahead lol and I can appreciate that. Thank you Izzy!! They try their best to accommodate your requests. 5/5 for customer service and staff. Cleanliness of the room 5/5 and comfort 5/5.

This excellent hotel is part of a Supermall in the up n coming section of ‚ÄúNew Cairo‚Äù. It allows some window shopping, as many stores are empty, where the affluent Egyptians partake and has an interesting food court if the two restaurants remain closed as during our stay.  15 minutes taxi from airport and an interesting location for those not interested in venturing into Cairo, it combines top notch service with an eclectic and curious ambiance. All the comforts and conveniences you have likely missed during your Egypt tour, await you here. We missed out on the restaurant review as it was closed for a private event (unusual) but the room service was excellent and delicious."

As a single and first-time traveler to Cairo, it was the perfect place to stay for a week, and understand what daily life is like. I was able to walk to so many places once I felt confident with the rhythm of the streets (thanks to Samir Fayek). This place has so much character and warmth to share even if it's not a ""luxurious"" hotel. (Personally, I'm more interested in the depth and a story -- if you're looking for that, you will find it here. ) Ayman, Emad, Abeer, Ibrahim, and Adel (and others that I know I'm forgetting, sorry!) made me feel so welcome and couldn't have been more gracious. On my next trip to Egypt, no matter where I am, I will go out of my way to return to Lotus to say hello to everyone there. Mr. Wafik Doss (owner of the hotel) is a gem and a true professional in the world of hospitality, and I will continue to stay at his hotels in the future when I'm back in Cairo. Mr. Doss kindly introduced me to Mina and Samir Fayek (tour guide experts) that I highly recommend using if you're staying at Lotus or Windor. (They've been working together for ~40 years.) Wafik and the Fayek Tour Guides work from their hearts; I was lucky enough to experience it and will be forever grateful.‚Ä¶"

I liked the manager very much and found him very helpful during the difficult 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

If any criticism maybe the breakfasts could be better. However for the price and the quality of the rooms ,mine with a balcony I found the place to my liking.  If I ever go back it will be there.

Good accommodation provided for the price that was paid.  The room and shared bathroom were clean and everything worked as it should.  There are heaps of great places to eat close by the hotel and the staff can offer suggestions on where to try.  The included breakfast was basic but adequate.  The included wi-fi was a bit hit and miss but this was the same all over Egypt.  The staff were professional and friendly.  They had offered us free pick up from the airport but unfortunately when we arrived there was no one there to meet us.  Apparently they organised it for the wrong time.

The hotel staff were knowledgeable about the area and were able to recommend some favourite local restaurants. I wasn't too keen on having a shared bathroom, but the rooms with a private bathroom were sold out when we booked.  The room was clean and simple when we arrived. There was an armoire for us to store our clothing. The A/C had a bucket to collect drips underneath, but this was never a problem. There were two shared bathrooms to use and they were kept clean and stocked with toilet paper. During our stay, we never had issues with the bathrooms being occupied when we needed them. The common room has books to borrow, and satellite TV, but no A/C. Despite our room overlooking a busy street (during Ramadan), we didn't find the noise to be too loud. Unlimited fresh towels were provided, and Wifi is free (and signal strength good) in all rooms.  You can't beat the hotel location. It is so central that you don't need a taxi to visit the shopping district (July 26th street and Ataba Market), many restaurants, and several attractions (Tahrir Square, Museum, Nile Corniche). The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ramses Train Station which was very convenient for us.‚Ä¶"

Location wise is in downtown, busy area and don't have to worry about safety late at night as the area is always filled with people. You can hear traffic from the room, so prepare earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  There are lots of restaurants to eat at and there is a confectionery right opposite the hostel.  I got a free upgrade to a room with 4 beds and attached bathroom despite booking for single bed shared bathroom.  In all, I recommend this hostel for budget travellers.‚Ä¶"

The host Adel and the staff Jasmine are super kind and helpful.  Jasmine is not just a worker there but becomes one of my best foreign friends, she took me to the famous traditional Koshary restaurant and even cooked for me the night before I left.    This is not a high-class hotel, but definitely a warm place if you want to make some friends and take rest.  The location is also very nice, you can easily grab the best dessert downstairs because the best El Abd is just across the street from travelers house.  It only takes around 10-15 mins by walk to the museum as well.  The only thing I would expect more is that they can refinish the room if they plan to make something different.  Some of the furnitures and facilities are not quite new.  But for a backpacker like me, this is still a nice place to stay.‚Ä¶"

We explained to the staff that it was not personal and they said the cleaning lady had not been for a few days and they could sort out the cleaning for us. This hostel has great potential if they can sort out these issues‚Ä¶"

The staff treats their guests not only like guests but also like friends. They speak good English and can help you with everything (sightseeing tips, tours ...) You can always have a seat in the  ""living room"" and share your interests with other people. The hostel is in the center of down town and you can reach everything easily by taxi or metro.  Don't hesitate to ask for what ever you need, they will help you in any case. Adel, Yasmin, Maghed, Sam ... Thank you for everything, I'll definitely come back ! "

The first room had major water damage, the second room had mold and fungus all over the bathroom (see attached pics). A staff member told me ""we are aware of the issues with the upper floors"" yet they try to pass them off to customers anyway. Also, the hotel may accept foreigners but it doesn't cater to them - forget about getting a drink of anything with alcohol in it, and forget about even getting a glass to your room if you plan to self-cater. The hotel only has plastic and paper disposable dixie cups ! They have no ice buckets and the best I could get was a plastic bag full - the place has no class of any kind. I'd suggest the nearby Sheraton or a chain hotel that would not be thinking so regionally. I wouldn't stay there again, sorry.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d13327782-Reviews-Cleopatra_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,I will make it simple and put the pros and cons of staying in this 3 star hotel.  Pros: Perfect location in the middle of Midan Tahrir with a magnificent view of the square from my room window  Friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping. Large room and electric kettle and bottled water supplied daily. The hotel is connected to La Poire one of Cairo's better known cafes.  Cons: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation with stained carpets. The bathroom leaked from both the sink and the shower. The drain in the shower didn't work and flooded the bathroom everytime I took a shower. Breakfast was basic and tasteless.  This hotel is not  cheap for the mediocre quality it offers  and  needs renovation soon. Just to add that the clientele was mainly Arab from various Arab countries with some Westerners and Africans.‚Ä¶
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d13327782-Reviews-Cleopatra_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Staff needs urgent training. Aside from one person in the reception, the others were terrible. The one who greeted me in was unwelcoming. After taking my passport information and charging my card, he got a personal phone call and he stepped away leaving me there standing for several minutes without any information from the room or other. When he came back, he rudely said that the bellman would guide me to the room. Staff definitely needs urgent training on manners, politeness and being welcoming in general. Breakfast was terrible. Don't bother to book this hotel with breakfast (they offer a pre-packaged version that is not fresh at all). It is better to go to the small cafe place on the corner that provides excellent options."

Walking distance to markets, places to eat, museum, the Nile, etc. The hotel has 24 hour security and scanning at the entrance. Reception is very helpful.

Friendly staff, who - I have to say- do not expect tips every time they serve you (which is very rare in Egypt)   Mediocre hotel: -Breakfast is very good -Rooms are ok if you don‚Äôt mind to sleep on firm mattresses -Pillows are not the best -Towels are very rough and scratchy  -I found a hair on one of a shampoo bottles from a previous customer - No hair conditioner - No slippers - Spacious dated rooms - Clean, but not spotless - Bathroom has mold  - Room keys have to be replaced every time you close your room and go out. And every time I get to the hotel at night, I go first to the reception to make sure I have access to my room. It‚Äôs not only me who had this issue! The entire group I‚Äôm with suffered from not working keys. - taxis and Uber know the hotel well.. so no hassle getting back to the hotel -Internet not good if you plan to work or make video calls.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The correct way to advertise Nile View hotel would be. Stay in a -5 star old rundown boat watching toxic waste dumping in the river. With an old rustic black mold infested carpet and mold in sink and shower and for entertainment staff entering your room late at night. And for a bonus get sick from the food and stay on the toilet looking at the Mold in the sink and shower. And for your safety in the event of an emergency there is a dirty old mattress in the hallway that you can hide under to keep you safe from predators. This is an experience of a lifetime. You can book this exciting holiday on Nile View deceptive website. Nile View hotels advertising is very misleading. It‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel it's a nothing star disgusting filthy old rundown boat that was so bad we both got very sick from the deplorable conditions. There is black mold everywhere in the carpet on the walls in the sink on the floors this was the most disgusting rundown hotel we have ever stayed at. And even the ceiling was falling apart. We witnessed hotel employees dumping toxic waste in the Nile. This hotel should not be allowed to be open as it is a health hazard. Our stay on the dirty old boat was a nightmare. Just read the numerous negative reviews and look at actual pictures posted by myself and others that stayed at Nile View they tell the truth.

I enjoyed very much my stay with German group of 20 who nearly cancelled their booking from Feb, 28 till Mar. 02, 2020 only because we discovered that this great boat relocated in Maddi and still not open.  Instead, boat management was thoughtful enough to arrange for an A/C brand new shuttle bus dialy! First we thought this is only to & from the museum only. But we were mostly pleased to discover that this thoughtfulness extents to every where, any time and any numbers of time! Thoughtfulness is reflected in staff attitude as well! We and the owner are really lucky to have this staff who LOVE the boat, love their work and care soooooo much for customer satisfaction. I barely had the chance to order anything! They care enough to fullfil every need and any remark before you even say it!!  Nile view Zamalek (now Maadi): you made me proud, you made all the guests happy, you gave us such a wonderful experience that I want really to thank each and every one of you. I can't believe how caring, clean and kind every one of you are! It's not just hospitality it's true kindness & care coming from professional people who received us befoooooore getting readying and finishing innovations! But they really made a ""hard to please group"" ; feel home. Can't thank you enough, we will sure be back to see you after renovations After special entrance gate is finished. After sundeck and covered pool are ready  Food there is unforgettable! I had the most wonderful kabsa, the best hawawshy and an amaaaazing mixed grill. Breakfast buffet is memorable! Oh my God! What great bakery do they have!!! Best omlette in town! Tameya is fried before you. All kinds of hot drinks! Real fresh orange juice. Real care and morning smile. Even if you are in a hurry, they would notice and make you the best snacks to go! O my God after 2 days I'm still overwhelmed with your kindness people! I remember each and every name of you: Reception: Ahmed, Sheriff Mostafa & Adel. Room service: Refaat Food and beverage: Nabieh Omlette stand: Hamad (very caring) Chief at the kitchen is the best (not sure about the name) Even room cleaning: Maha Bill man.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Please note that this hotel would not keep any rooms for you even after they confirm you that a room (or rooms) is reserved for you. They just look at the rooms available when you check in and assign one of the available rooms to you. They just don‚Äôt care if the available room is not of the type you requested.  We reserved two rooms for 3 nights and requested that they should be next to each other. The hotel staff acknowledged and sent me an email with confirmation numbers. This happened 4 months before our stay. But still, when we checked in, they gave us rooms in two different sections of the hotel. Essam (not sure how it is spelt) was at the front desk and he was extremely uncooperative. He was adamant that those were the only rooms available even though our reservation was confirmed 4 months in advance. He finally told us that he would give us two adjacent rooms the next day.  But the next day, Essam did the same thing again. He reassigned rooms to us but in two different sections again. We argued with him again but it was of no use. This man would try strongly NOT to help customers. Fortunately for us, there was one more person at the front desk and he tried to help us. His name was Ahmed. After listening to our request, he found out that there were two adjacent rooms available on a different floor and he assigned them to us. Our request was finally accommodated. Our first positive experience at this hotel was with Ahmed.   I had another weird experience at this hotel. I went to the restaurant on the roof top one day. Instead of directing me to a table, the waiter asked me, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù. I then asked him, ‚ÄúDo you have vegetarian food?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhat is vegetarian food?‚Äù I was stunned! He was a waiter at a restaurant and he didn‚Äôt even know what vegetarian food was. This place is obviously run by weird guys.  The only other positive experience was with the staff at the breakfast.

The breakfast were really good as well with a large selection of fruits meats pastries etc. Yes the ""rooms"" are not big but they are cabins not rooms, this is a Nile Boat not a hotel! The rooms were clean and everything worked.The staff were all amazing and tried their best, there were a few language issues as this is not a tourist establishment but frequented mostly by local people. We were always made to feel most welcome by the other guests and even joined in the festivities of a birthday party and an engagement party. the only complain was yes there is a smell of cigarette smoke in corridors etc but the is Egypt there is no such thing as a non smoking area.Would go back there again.‚Ä¶"

The staff is absolutely over the top polite, helpful and professional. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and the bathrooms are enormous with separate WC and bidet. Best of all though are the restaurants and downstairs lobby tea bar which transport you to another era. The Chinese restaurant (The name is 8)  was so excellent and the service was so incredible that we would‚Äôve eaten there every night but forced ourselves to explore other places, none comparable. Excellent designer shops also inside the hotel and fantastic concierge who helped us book some amazing tours and a sunset faluka boat tour with wine."

My room was facing the road opposing the zoo and there was a lot of noise at night. I had the impression that the balcony door was open. I was staying in a deluxe room but i saw no difference from the standard room, maybe more corridor room. The restaurant/bar at the pool wasn't great: they closed earlier than advertised and the drinks at the bar were awful. They don't know how to make a manhattan and the caipirinha was the worst i have ever had. Please also watch out: at check out, the desk person converted my Egyptian Pound invoice into USD and then proceeded to charge my credit card in GBP with a 4.5% markup without informing me. I pointed out to him that he was supposed to ask me in which currency i wanted to settle the bill, not decide for me. He tried to say that it was not him and that the machine automatically converted to GBP but i let him know that this was not teh first time i was checking out of a hotel with a credit card. Very dishonest and Unprofessional from a hotel of that standard. The 4.5% markup cost me an additional ¬£120. I don't know if the management told them to do this but it left me with a very bitter taste at the end of my stay.‚Ä¶"

Still missing that delicious and bountiful breakfast! "
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308077-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Cairo_at_Nile_Plaza-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The Four Seasons Cairo was a nice hotel but seemed a little worse for the wear. It was directly across from the Cairo Zoo which was in terrible shape and detracted from the overall ambiance. We traveled during Covid and the security was pretty obvious even though the hotel was mostly empty. 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308077-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Cairo_at_Nile_Plaza-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,An excellent hotel with very comfortable rooms and very attentive staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the ambiance of the hotel. Great swimming pool with large deck area and food service.  Hotel has eight restaurants in which we dined and all of which have superb food and service. They had our room ready for our 5:30 AM arrival and provided late checkout to accommodate our late airline schedule. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this great hotel.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308077-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Cairo_at_Nile_Plaza-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I stayed at FS Cairo Nile River during a four night sightseeing trip to Cairo on the way to Asia with my family. Having stayed at a variety of FS properties all over the world, I would not hesitate to highly recommend this hotel to even the most seasoned FS customers.  Though the property itself may not be as fancy as some of the FS hotels in other locations, it was the staff who made our stay above and beyond our (already high) expectations of FS service. There was nothing too big or small that they couldn‚Äôt accommodate. The concierge was amazing with helping us book all of the tours, excursions, travel we needed assistance  with. And when we needed to fly back early from a day trip to Luxor because one of our family members was having a health issue related to the extreme heat, they took care of all of the logistics.  Cairo is a very overwhelming city that can have significant language and cultural barriers to the North American traveller and the FS Cairo Nile is there to help navigate and make sure your trip is amazing. I would not hesitate to recommend this property.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308077-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Cairo_at_Nile_Plaza-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Firstly, I must say, that it seems some people in other reviews for this hotel, are getting confused between the 2 different Four Seasons hotels in Cairo. This is a review of The Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.   I stayed here last week for a couple of nights and everything was great. They were able to check me in early which was a bonus. I made use of the spa area and had a treatment, which was reasonably priced.   The outdoor pool area is a lovely oasis from the bustling and chaotic city, so I went down to the pool for a few hours a couple of times.   The restaurant for breakfast is spacious and has nice River views, and plenty of different options.   All staff were attentive and helpful."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"If you live old world charm, this is the place. The bones are beautiful - a cage elevator, grand front doors,  worn marble steps, balconies, floor to ceiling windows. Lively,and very nicely decorated. Beds are good, great wifi and air con, and conveniently above shops that sell snack and cheap water. Also a great, walkable location (and easy to grab an Uber).  The glassed in bathrooms are a creative solution and quite lovely. But they are really only ideal for people who are okay seeing each other on the toilet. Maybe not for besties, or work colleagues, or your dad.  The arranged driver was lovely and waited when we were delayed at airport. And staff Wafaa deserves to be rewarded for her courtesy, attentiveness, and competence.    The only real downside, and the reason we only enjoyed 1 included breakfast, was being cornered for the hard-sell by owner Mustafa. He wanted to change our current plans and pressed us to go to his other property so he could redesign our whole trip. PUSHY. This was so annoying and rude that we have cancelled our plans to return to this hotel at the end of our trip. Just to avoid this dude. Really too bad.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is located very close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum, and a few other old downtown highlights. While the outside of the building looks slightly dilapidated--clearly beyond the control of the hotel--the entrance to the hotel and the interior is nicely done and inviting. Staff are very kind, helpful, and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and have the essentials. In the dining area, complementary tea and water are on offer throughout the day.  A few drawbacks: the street noise is very clearly heard from within the rooms (windows are not double paned), and Cairenes LOVE to honk for any and all reasons so you'll still feel very in touch with street life even within the hotel. Breakfast is rather mediocre: expect toast, hard boiled eggs, some jam, and a small cup of yoghurt, accompanied by tea or nescafe. The bedsheets are in serious need of updating (they are extremely rough and scratchy, making sleeping difficult). The bathrooms are an afterthought - just a corner in the room cordoned off by half-frosted glass, so it is recommended that you are very comfortable sharing all bodily functions with whomever you share the room. Despite a clear 'no smoking' sign at the front desk, staff still smoke in common areas (entry, dining area). We stayed in the room at the far end of the hallway (there are only six rooms) and could smell the smoke very clearly from inside our room with the door shut. When I went to pay for our room at checkout, one staff member sat directly in front of me smoking. I called him out on it, pointing at the 'no smoking' sign right in front of us, and he apologised profusely and moved away with his cigarette. I am 100% confident he resumed smoking inside as soon as we left.  Some of the basics aren't looked after: the room we were given had no pillowcases on three of our four pillows, and only one towel. The rest of the linens were out at the cleaners, and since there was only one person on staff, we had to stand in for the staff at the front desk so they could run out and pick up the clean linen. Rooms don't come with soap, but we were given a bottle of liquid soap when we asked. Early checkin is USD 25 on top of the regular room charge. The staff offered to arrange a car back to the airport on our departure, quoting a price double of what we paid to get from the airport to the hotel in the first place. It is recommended to just take an Uber instead (EGP 100-125, depending on traffic and time of day). Overall, it's not a bad hotel, and the staff's kindness goes a long way to compensate for the weaknesses noted above.‚Ä¶"

They quickly made me feel welcome and went above and beyond to help me with any questions I had. This was by far the nicest hotel I stayed at in Egypt. It is a little tricky to locate it but that is the only downside. I hope to return to Cairo and would book here again!

Also I requested before for early morning breakfast and Ms Wafa prepared breakfast on time. Ms Wafa, Mr. Farag and Mr. Elsoky are very good people at Hotel. They also guided me about the city. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to others."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Wonderful authentic hotel right in the city center.  Spaceous and very clean.  The owner is a very experianced tourguide himself and very helpful in arranging your tours.  The staff is very friendly and make you feel welcome every minute of your stay. 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The Grand Agor was a perfect place for a few days in Cairo.  The staff, although small, is attuned to make your stay enjoyable.  The price is one class up from many of the small hotels downtown, but I found it to be secure and well situated.  You will be a $1 taxi ride from the current Egyptian Museum. Lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. My room was large with a great bathroom and shower, well lit."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We arrived at the hotel around 10.30 am, too early for check-in. Luckily, our room-to-be had been vacated and the bathroom cleaned, so we could use it and head out for a walk. Thanks to Achmed and Mustafa for that.  But I do not understand why they needed another two hours to get the room ready, when they did not even join the beds as we had requested a double bed at the time of booking or keep any towels when we returned close to 13:00. There were only hand/face towels kept, and even on the second day when we asked for bath towels, we got one, and were reluctantly asked, 'Do you need one more, I'll have to get it from the laundry.' Not being sure if he meant washed or unwashed laundry, we let it pass, lol. The shower fluctuates between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the staff tried their best to get it to work but it didn't, even on the second day. Add to it the tiny glass enclosure which they call a bathroom, there's no room to escape the hot and cold water, I almost got burnt! The glass cubicle idea is very weird, the frosting on the glass could have been complete near the toilet area at least! We stayed two nights, and were given two small bottles of water on the first day. When we asked on the second day, we were told it would be charged! When you check-in to a room, the least you expect is a hot shower, towels and water to drink. Sadly these were missing. The Wifi didn't work either. A special shout out to the lady in-charge of the cafe (I think her name is Ms. Wafa), she was very sweet and very efficient. The room itself was furnished well, with a nice wardrobe ideal for long stays. The two-rating is purely for the location and staff, and well the elevator! Grand Agor probably needs to decide if they want to be a hotel or a hostel. They are right now priced like a hotel with amenities like a hostel. There are much better cheaper places to stay in the downtown area, for once the Tripadvisor reviews did not match my experience, and I regret staying here.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"With the relentless chaos in Cairo, it‚Äôs important that you have a peaceful place to rest your head after a long day of exploring the city.   The hotel itself is quite new, which is great as the staff are always looking for feedback. The double room was very spacious with a lovely looking bathroom - unfortunately the hot water wasn‚Äôt too consistent so the showers could have been better. The bed was very comfortable, and there was a TV bracket on the wall but no TV. Unfortunately the WiFi was experiencing some issues during our stay so we didn‚Äôt have a great connection.   The hotel staff are just lovely; breakfast each morning was (as others have said) made with love, and the lovely lady would always offer us a tea or coffee when we were around. She really couldn‚Äôt do enough to take care of the guests and was one of our favourite parts of the hotel.   The location is also great, and central enough that you can pop back to use the toilet/have a coffee/take a breather from the Cairo madness, at any point during the day.   We arranged hotel pick up with the hotel after struggling to get in touch with them. If you do the same, make sure you go outside to meet your driver as only police are allowed inside the airport. Price was 25USD return which is very reasonable.   If we visit Cairo again we would stay at the Grand Agor - definitely recommend it.   The hotel also arranges tours for guests - we took one to the pyramids which was 20USD for both of us. Definitely do this. Avoid he public transport. Giza is hectic and stressful enough without waiting around for a bus! ‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I stayed at Grand Agor with my fiancee for 4 days at Grand Agor and it was the best experience we could have asked for during our whole trip. First off, do not let the entrance to the building where the hotel is distract you, it looks rough at best, but once you are inside the hotel, it is very nice. The staff is the friendliest you can find anywhere in the world, the rooms are wide and comfortable and  you get a feeling like you are staying at your friends house, and not actually at a hotel. Plus its location is very very good, right in downtown, near the museum, metro station, stores, etc. Last but not least the lift is very peculiar, not only is it very peculiar on the way it operates, but has its own theme music when moving, I know this sounds very odd, and it is, but for us it added a very special touch.‚Ä¶"

Its prime location in downtown allowed us to move freely in the area by foot or by public transport. Local restaurants were 5 minutes away, so is the Egyptian museum. The staff is super welcoming, professional and helpful. Every morning, our breakfast was made with love, by the lovely caretaker- Mrs Ouafa. Also, our room was spacious and very comfortable. Overall, it was a very nice hotel where price and comfort meets on the same level. We would highly recommend to those who wish to stay abit local and avoid the massive hotel chains.   **the hotel is actually located on the 2nd floor, so don‚Äôt be afraid to use the old lift! It is part of the egyptian experience!**"

He made multiple phone calls to the agency and made sure that the issue was resolved.  He was very pleasant and professional."

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be.

No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d301697-Reviews-Hilton_Cairo_Zamalek_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I think this Hilton is the best one in Cairo at the moment. They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶. I can recommend this hotel fully and can‚Äôt wait to return here.‚Ä¶"

The hotel lobby, coffee shop, outdoor pool and location were great. The morning buffet breakfast was excellent and the staff friendly and helpful.  However, the rooms are extremely old and dated. Additionally, they have not been maintained. On the first night, water from the bathroom above our room leaked and flooded our bathroom. The room balcony which had a fantastic view of the Nile was unusable as it hadn't been maintained and dirty.  I would still stay at this hotel due to the location, amenities and staff."

In the restaurant we were well taken care of by IMAN and the bell hop Ashfar made sure our Uber arrived on time and stayed with us until he arrived.

My husband and I are here for a few days prior to our Nile river cruise. Staff is extremely helpful at the dining areas, rooftop pool or just in the lobby areas. If you look confused they jump Right in to ask how they can assist you.   Restaurants - Middle eastern restaurant on the BR level was excellent - we had chicken soup, pigeons stuffed with rice etc. pigeons were a nice surprised with very dark meat but nicely spiced. E had a couple of tajines - but was way too much food for even the four of us.  SUGGESTION - Disclosing the portion size at ordering would help prevent food wastage. We felt bad at how much food we couldn‚Äôt eat. The restaurant on the R level was good for breakfast with representation of varied cultures. Ample types of food for people to decide what to eat. Pool bar - we came later in the day. Rooftop was clean with comfy lounges and couches. We had a couple of cocktails and some nibbles to watch the sun set.  Room COMFORTABLE BED! Slept really well. Soaker tub was appreciated and it helped me to wind down so I could sleep. Spacious bathroom. They stopped by and asked if we needed water. Appreciated  Maybe we can try the spa tomorrow‚Ä¶ Definitely would recommend!‚Ä¶"

I have addressed minor services concerns found within the first few hours of my hotel check-In to the receptionist, who addressed my service concerns to the GM of hotel, who then called all hotel directors and asked them to speak to me in person individually and all apologized and offered me some perks i.e. the restaurants, coffee shop, swimming pool, refund on stay fees, town tours fees, room services...etc.  In addition to this they continued to follow up with me to ensure all my needs were met and if I needed anything further.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d543043-Reviews-Cairo_World_Trade_Center_Hotel_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is by far THE worst ever. Everything was covered in dust in the room, we booked for a two week stay and unfortunately due to it being non refundable we had to live with the situation. Despite our daily complaints and reminders about how many guests are in the suite we never received the right amount of cutlery, the eggs were never cooked the way we asked which was simple ‚Äúwell done‚Äù it was always runny, the bathrooms were not clean at all, the balcony door would not shut completely, the window lock on one of the bedrooms would fall off as soon as we opened the window. These were not even the big issues.  We arrived on the 13th and today is the 22nd the water supply to the hotel was cut off. When we spoke to the staff/management they had claimed it was an issue with the main water supply of the area and not the hotels issue. We called a bunch of times to see if this was resolved and got no proper update.  We left the hotel to go out and before coming back we called in the afternoon to get an update and the status was that the water issue was not yet resolved and nobody went to clean the room yet. In the evening around 10:30 we called again and the hotel staff assured us the room was checked and cleaned and the water issue was resolved.   We got back to the hotel and went back to our suite, the whole apartment had water soaked into the fitted carpet. When we went down to speak to the  management they said they would change our suite for us which they did but  ended up being in an apartment suite  that was in worse condition in terms of cleanliness than the first one we stayed in!   There was dust everywhere the room looked like it was not used in a long time. There was dust on the toilet area, there was dirt and crumbs on the carpet, dust on shelves, the bedding in all three rooms had dust and hair on them. According to the staff the suite had been ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù earlier in the day. We were surprised by how confident they were in claiming everything had been cleaned when clearly it was not!    It is now 1:30am and the staff are cleaning under our supervision! We are supposed to be on a relaxing holiday and instead this trip has been full of stress and irritation due to negligence by hotel staff and management. Their compensation to us was slippers and tissue boxes!!!   The attached photos speak for themselves even the hotel staff who came to move our luggage to the ‚Äúnewly prepared suite‚Äù were embarrassed to see such a dirty and disgusting apartment suite. All they could say is on ‚Äúbehalf of the hotel we are truly sorry tell us what we can do to make it better‚Äù.   Seriously???!!!!!!  This is supposed to be under ‚ÄúHilton‚Äù hotel chains and it was no where near the Hilton standard!  We are extremely shocked and frustrated and disappointed about everything we have been through and still have to stay until our. Checkout as  it is non refundable.‚Ä¶"

It was a - 0000. The hotel pictures were falsely depicted online. I DO NOT recommend any international travelers to stay at this hotel. I PROMISE you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it certainly does not meet Covid protocol. It was unsanitary and management  and overall customer service was the WORST. We rented a suite to accommodate my family. We checked in at 4am in the morning and the complaints began as soon as we walked in. We ended our stay there by 11am. Total of 6 hours of disgust and poor hospitality. My cousin was locked into one of the bedrooms and we had to call the front desk from our cell phones since our hotel room phone was not working. It took them an hour to break down the door and get him out. The couches and dinning room chairs were stained, the carpet was stained and had lifted from the floor. The kitchen was not cleaned the stove had not been cleaned from the previous stay and was rusted and old. A loud electrical noise was coming from the kitchen that they couldn‚Äôt resolve and it lasted the entire time. The bathrooms were SCUM. Not cleaned. Toilets were stained and we could see scum and mold forming in all three bathrooms. No toilet paper, no clean towels, no soap‚Ä¶. Complete mess. I had initially reserved 3 nights and that quickly changed to a few hours. The manger that was the least bit helpful. I kept talking to her in English and she would respond in Arabic. She said she would not give us a refund that we would need to call Hilton hotline to complain. Although Hilton had said that the hotel would need to directly refund me. The hotel mgr mentioned they will be closing their doors anyways for remodeling in the next coming months. And she also said that since I spent more than a few hours in the hotel that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them to refund me. RIDICULOUS. This hotel needs to be reported to the Tourism Authorities really. Egypt is a beautiful and wonderful country full of hospitality and history and the people are full of heart and kindness. The hotel and management did not represent this country in any form or way. Shame on your Hilton World Trade.‚Ä¶"

The complimentary breakfast is same everyday and it‚Äôs not in international standard. The breakfast is not recommended for non-Egyptians.  2. There are 16 floors in this hotel and there is only one lift. You can imagine the wait time for the lift to come. Lift is always busy and we have to wait long to get the lift.  It‚Äôs better to stay in lower floor..  The lobby is not so clean as you can find lots of bees."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"If you live old world charm, this is the place. The bones are beautiful - a cage elevator, grand front doors,  worn marble steps, balconies, floor to ceiling windows. Lively,and very nicely decorated. Beds are good, great wifi and air con, and conveniently above shops that sell snack and cheap water. Also a great, walkable location (and easy to grab an Uber).  The glassed in bathrooms are a creative solution and quite lovely. But they are really only ideal for people who are okay seeing each other on the toilet. Maybe not for besties, or work colleagues, or your dad.  The arranged driver was lovely and waited when we were delayed at airport. And staff Wafaa deserves to be rewarded for her courtesy, attentiveness, and competence.    The only real downside, and the reason we only enjoyed 1 included breakfast, was being cornered for the hard-sell by owner Mustafa. He wanted to change our current plans and pressed us to go to his other property so he could redesign our whole trip. PUSHY. This was so annoying and rude that we have cancelled our plans to return to this hotel at the end of our trip. Just to avoid this dude. Really too bad.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is located very close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum, and a few other old downtown highlights. While the outside of the building looks slightly dilapidated--clearly beyond the control of the hotel--the entrance to the hotel and the interior is nicely done and inviting. Staff are very kind, helpful, and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and have the essentials. In the dining area, complementary tea and water are on offer throughout the day.  A few drawbacks: the street noise is very clearly heard from within the rooms (windows are not double paned), and Cairenes LOVE to honk for any and all reasons so you'll still feel very in touch with street life even within the hotel. Breakfast is rather mediocre: expect toast, hard boiled eggs, some jam, and a small cup of yoghurt, accompanied by tea or nescafe. The bedsheets are in serious need of updating (they are extremely rough and scratchy, making sleeping difficult). The bathrooms are an afterthought - just a corner in the room cordoned off by half-frosted glass, so it is recommended that you are very comfortable sharing all bodily functions with whomever you share the room. Despite a clear 'no smoking' sign at the front desk, staff still smoke in common areas (entry, dining area). We stayed in the room at the far end of the hallway (there are only six rooms) and could smell the smoke very clearly from inside our room with the door shut. When I went to pay for our room at checkout, one staff member sat directly in front of me smoking. I called him out on it, pointing at the 'no smoking' sign right in front of us, and he apologised profusely and moved away with his cigarette. I am 100% confident he resumed smoking inside as soon as we left.  Some of the basics aren't looked after: the room we were given had no pillowcases on three of our four pillows, and only one towel. The rest of the linens were out at the cleaners, and since there was only one person on staff, we had to stand in for the staff at the front desk so they could run out and pick up the clean linen. Rooms don't come with soap, but we were given a bottle of liquid soap when we asked. Early checkin is USD 25 on top of the regular room charge. The staff offered to arrange a car back to the airport on our departure, quoting a price double of what we paid to get from the airport to the hotel in the first place. It is recommended to just take an Uber instead (EGP 100-125, depending on traffic and time of day). Overall, it's not a bad hotel, and the staff's kindness goes a long way to compensate for the weaknesses noted above.‚Ä¶"

Luckily, our room-to-be had been vacated and the bathroom cleaned, so we could use it and head out for a walk. Thanks to Achmed and Mustafa for that.  But I do not understand why they needed another two hours to get the room ready, when they did not even join the beds as we had requested a double bed at the time of booking or keep any towels when we returned close to 13:00. There were only hand/face towels kept, and even on the second day when we asked for bath towels, we got one, and were reluctantly asked, 'Do you need one more, I'll have to get it from the laundry.' Not being sure if he meant washed or unwashed laundry, we let it pass, lol. The shower fluctuates between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the staff tried their best to get it to work but it didn't, even on the second day. Add to it the tiny glass enclosure which they call a bathroom, there's no room to escape the hot and cold water, I almost got burnt! The glass cubicle idea is very weird, the frosting on the glass could have been complete near the toilet area at least! We stayed two nights, and were given two small bottles of water on the first day. When we asked on the second day, we were told it would be charged! When you check-in to a room, the least you expect is a hot shower, towels and water to drink. Sadly these were missing. The Wifi didn't work either. A special shout out to the lady in-charge of the cafe (I think her name is Ms. Wafa), she was very sweet and very efficient. The room itself was furnished well, with a nice wardrobe ideal for long stays. The two-rating is purely for the location and staff, and well the elevator! Grand Agor probably needs to decide if they want to be a hotel or a hostel. They are right now priced like a hotel with amenities like a hostel. There are much better cheaper places to stay in the downtown area, for once the Tripadvisor reviews did not match my experience, and I regret staying here.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"With the relentless chaos in Cairo, it‚Äôs important that you have a peaceful place to rest your head after a long day of exploring the city.   The hotel itself is quite new, which is great as the staff are always looking for feedback. The double room was very spacious with a lovely looking bathroom - unfortunately the hot water wasn‚Äôt too consistent so the showers could have been better. The bed was very comfortable, and there was a TV bracket on the wall but no TV. Unfortunately the WiFi was experiencing some issues during our stay so we didn‚Äôt have a great connection.   The hotel staff are just lovely; breakfast each morning was (as others have said) made with love, and the lovely lady would always offer us a tea or coffee when we were around. She really couldn‚Äôt do enough to take care of the guests and was one of our favourite parts of the hotel.   The location is also great, and central enough that you can pop back to use the toilet/have a coffee/take a breather from the Cairo madness, at any point during the day.   We arranged hotel pick up with the hotel after struggling to get in touch with them. If you do the same, make sure you go outside to meet your driver as only police are allowed inside the airport. Price was 25USD return which is very reasonable.   If we visit Cairo again we would stay at the Grand Agor - definitely recommend it.   The hotel also arranges tours for guests - we took one to the pyramids which was 20USD for both of us. Definitely do this. Avoid he public transport. Giza is hectic and stressful enough without waiting around for a bus! ‚Ä¶"

First off, do not let the entrance to the building where the hotel is distract you, it looks rough at best, but once you are inside the hotel, it is very nice. The staff is the friendliest you can find anywhere in the world, the rooms are wide and comfortable and  you get a feeling like you are staying at your friends house, and not actually at a hotel. Plus its location is very very good, right in downtown, near the museum, metro station, stores, etc. Last but not least the lift is very peculiar, not only is it very peculiar on the way it operates, but has its own theme music when moving, I know this sounds very odd, and it is, but for us it added a very special touch.‚Ä¶"

Its prime location in downtown allowed us to move freely in the area by foot or by public transport. Local restaurants were 5 minutes away, so is the Egyptian museum. The staff is super welcoming, professional and helpful. Every morning, our breakfast was made with love, by the lovely caretaker- Mrs Ouafa. Also, our room was spacious and very comfortable. Overall, it was a very nice hotel where price and comfort meets on the same level. We would highly recommend to those who wish to stay abit local and avoid the massive hotel chains.   **the hotel is actually located on the 2nd floor, so don‚Äôt be afraid to use the old lift! It is part of the egyptian experience!**"

Good to stay.  The hotel is far from the city center, do shopping is not easy.  The travel services to visit tourist spots provided by the Taxi booth of the hotel (named Last Minute travel services) was not up to the mark. The driver dropped me on the Egyptian museum and he was supposed to stay  at the gate. But when I come back visiting the museum, I did not find him. Then I called him and he declined the call. I sent him message , he responded sending message after half an hour without giving any specific time of coming. I was puzzled, waiting and waiting. Then I was thinking to hire another Taxi. Finally he came after more than an hour.   The services provided was also costly. I could hire a Taxi using the APP less than half price.  On the way back, it was planned to take me a super store for buying dry fruits. But  he did not took me to a right store. It was felt to me that he did it intentionally.‚Ä¶"

But Ritz Carlton was amazing and gave us a great start to our holiday. I had corresponded with the hotel and requested for connecting rooms. On checkin due to my platinum elite status we were upgraded to connecting rooms facing the Nile, and free breakfast. The rooms were great, location was amazing and breakfast was great. My kids were really happy with all of it. We also got breakfast boxes packed for us. Starting our trip here kicked off our Egypt explorations to a great start. The forums have been so great and we used the Cairo airport shuttle which was seamless to be dropped off at the airport.  The front office staff was always great, especially Mahmoud who checked us in and  the location is really great.‚Ä¶"

We originally booked city executive suite and were upgraded to Superb Nile view. From the moment you step in you feel welcomed and the service was up to bar. The outstanding staff at the lounge did not reserve a minute to offer help and a very friendly atmosphere. It was so touching that when they realised our love for Mango they prepared a surprising Mango feast for us. It was very touching to us. Noise were not as bad as highlighted in many reviews after all we understand that we are living in the hustle and bustle of cairo city. Ritz Carlton Cairo is among the best I ever stayed in, in terms of pleasant smile and friendliness. I am afraid I might miss some names but every staff we met were top notch. Especially would like to thank Ossama and Asmaa from the lounge, the waiters team in the lounge and cleaning team in 12 floors who kept the room spotless. Thank you all.‚Ä¶"

Example - told iced-tea is a special order.  While it is expected that people at local venues may not speak English, it is reasonable to expect staff at the concierge, reception and restaurant should be able to communicate in English.

Many great restaurants and bars are close by and easy reachable within a 5 minute taxi ride. The hotel, rooms and staff were exactly what we expected from a Ritz Carlton Hotel, just perfect."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d8704648-Reviews-The_Nile_Ritz_Carlton_Cairo-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We stayed here for five nights as part of a larger and longer Egypt trip. We'd certainly start off by saying what a perfect location this property is, right at Tahrir Square and the Egyptian Museum. It's so close as well to many of the hip restaurants around this side of the Nile. The hotel itself is well secured, and the moment you pass through the metal detectors into the lobby, you are greeted by a fantastic Guest Relations team and a wonderful public space on the ground floor. In fact, all of the public areas seem current, well maintained and appointed with everything you would need. However, once we got to the room the story was a little different: we had a junior-suite, overlooking Tahrir Square, and off the bat our A/C was not working properly (specifically, the thermostat was not functioning, no matter what we changed the temperature to there was no change). The room also had an older smell, maybe even a smokey smell that was apparent each time you would walk in. The bathroom were huge and very clean, but had older fixtures with discoloration. Much of the room had this, in fact, with some parts of the ceiling having dry wall cracking and leaving little white crumbs around. Did any of this inhibit our experience? Not really, as the service makes up for it. But it's not exactly what I'd expect from The Ritz-Carlton. I'd like to give a final shout-out to Mina Aziz from Guest Relations: he made sure every request we had was fulfilled and even helped make some special cases work for us. Any future visits to Cairo would still have us staying here over any other option.‚Ä¶"

The gym is large with treadmills, ellipticals, and a plethora of weights and machines. We love a large gym and I will add extra time in the morning for this one. The breakfast is a huge display of every option you could imagine. The lobby piano is a nice way to enjoy their treats. Having a bank on sight helps when getting out cash and change. Enjoy your stay"

Food was a decent spread of international/ local cuisine and promptly served     **NEGATIVE** Now the bad  - ROOM ALLOCATION  Despite me asking around 2/3 times at check-in to have a room away from noise and any events they put me in a room right beneath the top bar.  Consequently every night at around 2AM loud music would reverberate into my room to the sounds of Despacito.  As you can imagine I asked if I could be moved again 2/3 times where they would answer let me get back to you and nothing happened.  For a work trip this is really not acceptable.  Did I also mention as well we saw a mouse run across the lobby!  - THIRD PARTY CHAUFFER On Wednesday last week we hired a car from the hotel from the ‚ÄòMUSTANG COMPANY‚Äô.  I had forgot my wallet in the car getting out which I realised 2 min entering my room.  Upon receiving it back from the driver I noticed all the money had been taken out (USD/AED).  I spoke to the managers Mr Hossam/ Ahmed right away who informed me they would investigate to no avail.    Their rationale it‚Äôs a third party company where there is nothing they can do.  Whilst I understand it would be very hard to prove, this is the RITZ not a 2 star BNB and they should use reputable providers.  In my 14 years travelling for work I‚Äôve never had anything like this which is a real shame.

We had to change rooms twice, the first room was dirty, a peice of the sink fell off in the middle of the night scaring us, and some furniture was missing.   The second room was a nightmare, the bathroom stunk of sewer and rotten egg and the AC leaked like a waterfall. We complained about the AC the night it started leaking, then again the next morning, then again during the afternoon. In the afternoon, housekeeping came and put a bucket under the AC to fix the problem. After complaining for the 4th time, the maintenance guy came and hit the AC with a broom as it was his way of repairing it. Of course this strategy did not work and the AC started leaking again at 11PM. We called the reception and maintenance and they only showed up to our room at 11:35 PM after 4 phone calls. The maintenance guy requested the reception to change our room as fixing the AC would take a lot of time, they refused. The maintenance workers started using machinery to fix the AC as we were in the room.  Finally they changed our rooms to a better one at almost 1AM because I was crying hysterically in the reception from exhaustion because I had a morning flight the next day.   Oh and they left a full trash bag (that was not ours) in front of the room for an entire night.  Please save yourselves the trouble a book another hotel.‚Ä¶"

We hoped to enjoy one of the two swimming pools and take a last sunbeam, but in this time of the year the pools are both in the shadow. We took diner in the evening in the beautiful garden near the pool. The food was delicious, but they don't have a wine card. They don't serve alcoholic drinks, but customers are allowed to bring bottles from outside the hotel, we saw several regulars with their own bottle at the table. Minus was the next morning, as we had to take an early flight and our breakfast was included in the price, I agreed with the staff in the lobby that they would bring it in the room before our departure. Only they brought us to bags to take in the taxi, not very comfortable. We left the bags untouched for the taxi driver.‚Ä¶"

Attention to detail in the design is matched by the attention to great customer service and delicious food. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and will definitely stay there again in the future.

We all selected from the Christmas menu and made our choices a few days before coming. The food was excellent and service really attentive without being obtrusive. I can highly recommend.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1722944-Reviews-Villa_Belle_Epoque-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I chose the hotel for the convenience to where I was going to be working. The hotel is in a very nice part of Cairo, hard to reconcile the lushness here with the normal Egyptian scenery of sand dunes and camels. There are various embassies and institutes nearby and a big police presence which was reassuring The hotel itself is a colonial residence and quaint. Certainly, very different from the chains. The ambience within is that of a boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I was very happy with my room and the amenities. My only quibble was the wi-fi and not particularly comfortable work conditions The outside seating area is lovely to sit out the sunset. The pool is small but nice, but is in the dining area, and so you have limited access if you are working, so I had to make sure to return early to make use of it. Many of the reviews mention the food.  Out of necessity I are there all 3 nights I stayed. I found the food to be mediocre. I later stayed in other hotels nearby and found some brilliant places to eat and regret I was not more adventurous when I stayed at the Belle Epoque If I was being a tourist and not working, I would certainly recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1722944-Reviews-Villa_Belle_Epoque-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I seldom write reviews. But I saw the mix bag of reviews for Belle Epoque, I felt the need to chime in.  I am not a big hotel kind of a traveler. So, when I booked the flights to Cairo, I started looking. This was the only (or the only nice looking) boutique hotel I found. Some friends warned me Egypt doesn't do boutique hotels well, and yes, the reviews freaked me out a bit. But I couldn't bring myself to book one of those chain hotels... so I took a gamble.  It paid off. Really paid of!  The neighborhood is tree-filled, lush green, relaxed and quiet residential area loved by embassies and posh locals. Lots of nice restaurants, cafes, shops within walking distance. Locals told me they walk everywhere in this neighborhood. Many also told me they often come to Belle Epoque  for the pool, or for lunch.  You may spend your day in the hustle bustle of busy chaotic Cairo doing tourists stuff, so why not pick the most laid back beautiful villa to go back to relax at night? I loved Cairo, and I am definitely coming back. And when I am coming back, I will definitely stay here again.  PS: beautifully decorated spacious rooms, nice and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We (family of four) had made a reservation to stay for a night in Royal Galaxy Suites in early September 2018. The reservation was made over a month in advance. On the day when we arrived at the hotel, the receptionists stated that they had given the room to someone else as tried to debit the amount from the card but were unable to (this has never happened and I've used that card in over six countries including Egypt). They had sent a mail through booking.com to update card details but I was unable to access as I was traveling through the day.   They offered to send us to another hotel which was in a more remote part of town. When we arrived there, they stated that this would cost USD 90 instead of the USD 70 that was the original price. The rooms were of poor quality and they were just trying to take advantage of tourists who do not know the city well. We refused and moved out to find our own accommodation. They realized that we didn't take bait and within five minutes they sent the receptionist boy downstairs telling that the price was negotiable and that they would match the earlier price. However, we had decided to figure things out ourselves and walked out. These hotels use this as a business model to show fancy locations and rooms to customers and send you to another place (with a poorer quality) when you actually turn up. I also lost my faith in booking.com in allowing such hotels to operate. Never ever book in this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The first impression when you arrive is that the place looks old and not well maintained. they shouldn't call it an hotel, it can be considered as guest house. The rooms are not well maintained and old.  However, the location itself is nice and the view to whole cairo is amazing. in addition, the friendly staff is very strong additive that compensates the negative things i found in this place."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I would have rated this 3.5 stars if I could, as 4 stars I think is too much...but 0.5 is not an option, so 3 stars is enough. The best thing about this hotel is ofcourse the view, wich indeed is great, with the Nile and also the pyramids (if you book a room with this view). We had a very nice feeling to stay in the balcony and watch the sunset. Also, the staff is polite and helped me to order some food and drinks that we ate in the balcony. Also you can buy sheesha and smoke it in the balcony. The room was spacious and clean. On the other hand there are some negative aspects also. The hotel itself is just a part of a big building, so only the 38'th and 39'th floors are for the hotel. The elevator looked a little bit shabby...Although clean, in the bathroom was a strong smell like a shop full of plastic china stuff (it was from the shower courtain); not that big of a problem, but still.  There is no restaurant like they say (at least on booking.com), but just a room with some tables to eat. The breakfast was quite poor, an omlette and some gem and the kitchen looked not very clean. Also no towels changed or cleaning the room in the morning. And sound proof not good. The idiot next room waked us up at 3 AM in the night because he banged the door and talked loud on the balcony... Poor wifi in our room.  All in all, it was an ok stay, great view, but a little too expensive for what you get. We paid 110 euros for 2 nights on the room with nile and pyramids view; I think a fair price would have been around 70-80 euros.‚Ä¶"

The bathroom was even nicer; we all love going to the pool  together and it was so much fun The best part of this hotel, though, was the location: it was close to many things, In the end i would like to thank Mr. Hatem Samir and Mr. Ahmed Hassan for welcoming me."

The staff and management at Havana are one of its strongest assets. Always super helpful, friendly and efficient. It‚Äôs location in Syria St in Mohandeseen is another draw card with so many fantastic shops and restaurants (I like the barber shops too, the best shave and haircut you can find!). The rooms and bathrooms are well above standard for a 3star hotel in my opinion. Good restaurant and shisha bar on site, licensed bar, and great coffee."

Anyways the duty manager there did nothing to help he said that he checked the cameras in corridors and no one had entered our rooms. To cut it short my rooms safe box at my arrival was not working and when i asked the receptionist to get it fix he came with a box full of keys and had reset it and left and the sexond day this happened.  Even the taxi we had asked to pick us took us directly to the way to airport while we hadn‚Äôt told them too so when we asked him he is going to the wrong way he said that the guy at the hotel said you are going to the airport as i think they thought we are going back home to our country.  This is just a bad experience but definitely true as we both friends in different rooms got some money missing from our saftey box.  Please be careful thats is my message.‚Ä¶"

The hotel is located in the Zamalek district, in an area well connected to the points of interest of the city and at the same time a quiet area. the breakfast was good and with excellent pastries"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is in a good location and the room was clean, the bed comfortable. If you ask, you can get eggs cooked fresh for breakfast.  However, I requested a superior room because the room details stated that superior rooms have a balcony, and mine did not. This was very disappointing since this was the only reason I requested a superior room. Instead, it had a kitchenette which is strange and made it feel like a self contained apartment rather than a superior room in a hotel. I would have been better off with a regular room. Not long after I arrived, after waiting almost an hour past checkin time as the room was not ready, foul smelling water poured from an outlet under the sink, although I had not turned on the tap. The maintenance man did not listen when I explained where the water was coming from and that I had not turned on the tap, and instead fixed what would have been another problem had I done so, the broken pipe leading from the sink to the outlet above where the water came from. He also fixed a blockage which may have temporarily solved the mystery water issue. A young man came and carefully mopped the floor with antiseptic and clean water, but the smell lingered in the kitchenette for the duration of my stay, which fortunately was only one night.  When I went to have a shower I found the hot water was barely lukewarm, not matter how long I let the tap run for. There was no hot water in this room the entire stay.  Overall, it was overpriced for what I got, even for Zamalek.‚Ä¶"

The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was also really clean. The staff were so friendly and kind and went out of their way to help us with everything. The location of the hotel was perfect - there is a Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs in walking distance. There is a bank to exchange money nearby and lots of cute little cafes too. The area is really safe and we would often go out late in the evening and had no issues. Would definitely recommend staying here.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"There are more pros than cons about this little hotel. The location is fantastic and in the heart of Egypt‚Äôs finest neighborhood, Zamalek. Within a walking distance, you will find countless shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarkets and pharmacies. Literally everything you will ever need.  The hotel has some nice bars and restaurants. For a hotel this size, I was surprised they have some good options for a drink or a meal.  The room is small but very clean and you wouldn‚Äôt need it much if you are planning to move around.   Staff are generally very helpful and polite which is again something you might not find in 5-star hotels around Cairo.  Now when it comes to the cons of this hotel. It will be the elevator which is very slow and tiny so if the hotel is busy, you will suffer a bit.  Also, there‚Äôs no soundproofing system so you can hear everything happening next door but the managers were very supportive to control this.  I will definitely be staying here again.‚Ä¶"

Booked at this hotel for 3 nights, when I reached the hotel and saw how small and normal the room is for such fee, I went directly to the reception and told them I wanna cancel the reservation cz It‚Äôs not what I expected. They said okay no prob but there is a cancellation fee which is 122$, so If you want you can stay the night and pay the fee so you won‚Äôt lose it.  We stayed me and my friend, the second day they come and say we need 67$ more !!!  So basically the room is for 190$ (more than its own price) !!!!!!!!"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This review is regarding day use at the Gabriel hotel pool.  I have been here more than 20 times for day use and ive spent the night 4 times and used to be a big fan. But since Andrew left its gone down the toilet. First of all we booked through the whatsapp booking. They asked for photo i.d of all my friends that wanted to come. Kind of ridiculous. Then they wanted all our facebook accounts. Presumably to check we dont look ugly or poor. Again ridiculous, this is a swimming pool not Studio 54. We are two couples in our 30s40s. We should not have to show a stupid social media presence to enter a pool. On arrival they told us that the reservation was to reserve attendance not to reserve sunbeds. That's not what a reservation is. So there were no umbrellas left and not enough sunbeds for our group (3 present and 2 joining later). There was one double bed left right next to the showers and speakers - least desirable spot. We asked for a spare sunbed to be bought over and put beside our bed as we are a group of 5. They refused. Said it was too difficult and just kept repeating ""no way"" because according to the obnoxious attendance the beds fit 7 people. The bed was the width of 3 pillows meaning if three people laid side by side like sardines they could fit, but not comfortably. I can guarantee no egyptian woman would be expected to be 7 to a sunbed but screw the white chicks they can suck it up? After an extended argument they put a sunbed next to the double bed which was no difficulty at all. We then asked for the spare umbrella but they refused saying the umbrellas that were ironically on wheels could not be moved. We had driven a long way so chose to stay, but without any shade we left after 3 hours. We would have liked to spend the day - the hottest day of the year so far. Its also important to mention that the dj blasts annoying house music too loud. They wont turn it down. This has been a problem on another visit when we were the only family at the pool and they still wouldnt turn it down a fraction. We couldn't talk  side by side without shouting.  Also on another visit when we had to be vetted on our facebook to make sure we were not scumbags there were people so ridiculously drunk they vomitted in the pool. We reported it to the waiter who went over to have a word and walked away with their drinks order! Its gotten gradually worse, but this visit really was the limit. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.‚Ä¶"

It‚Äôs just a small hotel (arround 25 rooms) without buffet breakfast, broken cheap-fancy furniture, and minimum cleaning.   The hotel itself is a party for Egiptian people: starting in the pool (where you can‚Äôt simply relax because of the noise of ‚Äúthe music‚Äù - arabian reggeton‚Ä¶ later on the party continues in the ‚Äúrestaurant area‚Äù which is exactly in the middle of the hotel, so you can easily hear the excesively loud music from your room till very after the midnigth‚Ä¶  The breakfast is poor, and defficient quality. People attending the tables don‚Äôt speak english, and what you get isn‚Äôt frequently what you really ordered.  We choosed this hotel because of it‚Äôs nearby the airport, and it‚Äôs side by side to a big shopping mall (SunCity) which is mostly dead (5 floors and only very very few shops open).  Deffinetly I do not recommend this property unless you are looking for bad rest, egiptian partys all the time, bad food and a barely dead surrounding.  FAR, VERY FAR FROM A 5 STARS‚Ä¶ run away!‚Ä¶"

The minute We pulled up  to the property We were greeted at the car with the bell man waiting to collect our bags and guide us to the front desk. Izzy who works at the front desk, had everything ready and waiting for our arrival, she was 10 steps ahead lol and I can appreciate that. Thank you Izzy!! They try their best to accommodate your requests. 5/5 for customer service and staff. Cleanliness of the room 5/5 and comfort 5/5. Did not like that the bar was close for the nights we stayed there so that really was our only con about our stay. I definitely recommend the Gabriel, two thumbs up!"

This excellent hotel is part of a Supermall in the up n coming section of ‚ÄúNew Cairo‚Äù. It allows some window shopping, as many stores are empty, where the affluent Egyptians partake and has an interesting food court if the two restaurants remain closed as during our stay.  15 minutes taxi from airport and an interesting location for those not interested in venturing into Cairo, it combines top notch service with an eclectic and curious ambiance. All the comforts and conveniences you have likely missed during your Egypt tour, await you here. We missed out on the restaurant review as it was closed for a private event (unusual) but the room service was excellent and delicious."

If you want to stay in same-same sterile modern international standard accommodation, you wouldn‚Äôt choose the Lotus Hotel. If, however, you seek old-world charm (without the fancy makeover that has arguably spoilt so many of the old-world hotels in Egypt), the Lotus is a really great choice. The rooms are simply furnished, very clean, & very adequate. The highlight of the hotel is the staff, who are wonderfully kind, helpful, welcoming, & 100% genuine in their care of their guests. The hotel is in a great downtown location, with plenty of local caf√©s, bars, restaurants, & shops in easy walking distance. I stayed at the Lotus on 3 occasions during my recent visit to Egypt.

As a single and first-time traveler to Cairo, it was the perfect place to stay for a week, and understand what daily life is like. I was able to walk to so many places once I felt confident with the rhythm of the streets (thanks to Samir Fayek). This place has so much character and warmth to share even if it's not a ""luxurious"" hotel. (Personally, I'm more interested in the depth and a story -- if you're looking for that, you will find it here. ) Ayman, Emad, Abeer, Ibrahim, and Adel (and others that I know I'm forgetting, sorry!) made me feel so welcome and couldn't have been more gracious. On my next trip to Egypt, no matter where I am, I will go out of my way to return to Lotus to say hello to everyone there. Mr. Wafik Doss (owner of the hotel) is a gem and a true professional in the world of hospitality, and I will continue to stay at his hotels in the future when I'm back in Cairo. Mr. Doss kindly introduced me to Mina and Samir Fayek (tour guide experts) that I highly recommend using if you're staying at Lotus or Windor. (They've been working together for ~40 years.) Wafik and the Fayek Tour Guides work from their hearts; I was lucky enough to experience it and will be forever grateful.‚Ä¶"

It offers good value for money and the staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak English - some well. The beds are comfortable and the hotel gives a choice of western or Egyptian breakfast included in the very reasonable rates. I liked the manager very much and found him very helpful during the difficult 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. I almost had to stay on after the Cairo airport closed and would have felt safe there for weeks if that had happened. The hotel is well located too - close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum and many restaurants and other amenities."

It's a ten minute walk to the museum and plenty of eating options close by.  The hotel is an old time kind of place but I liked it. It had character.  The people who worked there also were friendly and and good banter. There is a bar upstairs where you can get a beer and chill out after the sightseeing during the day.  If any criticism maybe the breakfasts could be better. However for the price and the quality of the rooms ,mine with a balcony I found the place to my liking.  If I ever go back it will be there. Or possibly the Windsor hotel the one I should of been in which is the sister hotel closed for now. Keep up the good work guys.  We will return one day !!"

The included wi-fi was a bit hit and miss but this was the same all over Egypt.  The staff were professional and friendly.  They had offered us free pick up from the airport but unfortunately when we arrived there was no one there to meet us.  Apparently they organised it for the wrong time.

I wasn't too keen on having a shared bathroom, but the rooms with a private bathroom were sold out when we booked.  The room was clean and simple when we arrived. There was an armoire for us to store our clothing. The A/C had a bucket to collect drips underneath, but this was never a problem. There were two shared bathrooms to use and they were kept clean and stocked with toilet paper. During our stay, we never had issues with the bathrooms being occupied when we needed them. The common room has books to borrow, and satellite TV, but no A/C. Despite our room overlooking a busy street (during Ramadan), we didn't find the noise to be too loud. Unlimited fresh towels were provided, and Wifi is free (and signal strength good) in all rooms.  You can't beat the hotel location. It is so central that you don't need a taxi to visit the shopping district (July 26th street and Ataba Market), many restaurants, and several attractions (Tahrir Square, Museum, Nile Corniche). The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ramses Train Station which was very convenient for us.‚Ä¶"

Their rooms and bathrooms are basic and also clean.  The owner and his staffs are all good people to talk to. And they are willing to help and give advice on anything relating to having a good time in Cairo or Egypt.  They can arrange airport transfers and if you book atleast a certain number of nights, you will get a free transfer.   Location wise is in downtown, busy area and don't have to worry about safety late at night as the area is always filled with people. You can hear traffic from the room, so prepare earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  There are lots of restaurants to eat at and there is a confectionery right opposite the hostel.  I got a free upgrade to a room with 4 beds and attached bathroom despite booking for single bed shared bathroom.  In all, I recommend this hostel for budget travellers.‚Ä¶"

The host Adel and the staff Jasmine are super kind and helpful.  Jasmine is not just a worker there but becomes one of my best foreign friends, she took me to the famous traditional Koshary restaurant and even cooked for me the night before I left.    This is not a high-class hotel, but definitely a warm place if you want to make some friends and take rest.  The location is also very nice, you can easily grab the best dessert downstairs because the best El Abd is just across the street from travelers house.  It only takes around 10-15 mins by walk to the museum as well.  The only thing I would expect more is that they can refinish the room if they plan to make something different.  Some of the furnitures and facilities are not quite new.  But for a backpacker like me, this is still a nice place to stay.‚Ä¶"

We explained to the staff that it was not personal and they said the cleaning lady had not been for a few days and they could sort out the cleaning for us.

Also, the hotel may accept foreigners but it doesn't cater to them - forget about getting a drink of anything with alcohol in it, and forget about even getting a glass to your room if you plan to self-cater. The hotel only has plastic and paper disposable dixie cups ! They have no ice buckets and the best I could get was a plastic bag full - the place has no class of any kind. I'd suggest the nearby Sheraton or a chain hotel that would not be thinking so regionally. I wouldn't stay there again, sorry.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d13327782-Reviews-Cleopatra_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,I will make it simple and put the pros and cons of staying in this 3 star hotel.  Pros: Perfect location in the middle of Midan Tahrir with a magnificent view of the square from my room window  Friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping. Large room and electric kettle and bottled water supplied daily. The hotel is connected to La Poire one of Cairo's better known cafes.  Cons: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation with stained carpets. The bathroom leaked from both the sink and the shower. The drain in the shower didn't work and flooded the bathroom everytime I took a shower. Breakfast was basic and tasteless.  This hotel is not  cheap for the mediocre quality it offers  and  needs renovation soon. Just to add that the clientele was mainly Arab from various Arab countries with some Westerners and Africans.‚Ä¶
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d13327782-Reviews-Cleopatra_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Staff needs urgent training. Aside from one person in the reception, the others were terrible. The one who greeted me in was unwelcoming. After taking my passport information and charging my card, he got a personal phone call and he stepped away leaving me there standing for several minutes without any information from the room or other. When he came back, he rudely said that the bellman would guide me to the room. Staff definitely needs urgent training on manners, politeness and being welcoming in general. Breakfast was terrible. Don't bother to book this hotel with breakfast (they offer a pre-packaged version that is not fresh at all). It is better to go to the small cafe place on the corner that provides excellent options."

And every time I get to the hotel at night, I go first to the reception to make sure I have access to my room. It‚Äôs not only me who had this issue! The entire group I‚Äôm with suffered from not working keys. - taxis and Uber know the hotel well.. so no hassle getting back to the hotel -Internet not good if you plan to work or make video calls.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The correct way to advertise Nile View hotel would be. Stay in a -5 star old rundown boat watching toxic waste dumping in the river. With an old rustic black mold infested carpet and mold in sink and shower and for entertainment staff entering your room late at night. And for a bonus get sick from the food and stay on the toilet looking at the Mold in the sink and shower. And for your safety in the event of an emergency there is a dirty old mattress in the hallway that you can hide under to keep you safe from predators. This is an experience of a lifetime. You can book this exciting holiday on Nile View deceptive website. Nile View hotels advertising is very misleading. It‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel it's a nothing star disgusting filthy old rundown boat that was so bad we both got very sick from the deplorable conditions. There is black mold everywhere in the carpet on the walls in the sink on the floors this was the most disgusting rundown hotel we have ever stayed at. And even the ceiling was falling apart. We witnessed hotel employees dumping toxic waste in the Nile. This hotel should not be allowed to be open as it is a health hazard. Our stay on the dirty old boat was a nightmare.

Instead, boat management was thoughtful enough to arrange for an A/C brand new shuttle bus dialy! First we thought this is only to & from the museum only. But we were mostly pleased to discover that this thoughtfulness extents to every where, any time and any numbers of time! Thoughtfulness is reflected in staff attitude as well! We and the owner are really lucky to have this staff who LOVE the boat, love their work and care soooooo much for customer satisfaction. I barely had the chance to order anything! They care enough to fullfil every need and any remark before you even say it!!

I can't believe how caring, clean and kind every one of you are!

What great bakery do they have!!! Best omlette in town! Tameya is fried before you. All kinds of hot drinks! Real fresh orange juice. Real care and morning smile. Even if you are in a hurry, they would notice and make you the best snacks to go! O my God after 2 days I'm still overwhelmed with your kindness people!

They just look at the rooms available when you check in and assign one of the available rooms to you. They just don‚Äôt care if the available room is not of the type you requested.  We reserved two rooms for 3 nights and requested that they should be next to each other. The hotel staff acknowledged and sent me an email with confirmation numbers. This happened 4 months before our stay. But still, when we checked in, they gave us rooms in two different sections of the hotel. Essam (not sure how it is spelt) was at the front desk and he was extremely uncooperative. He was adamant that those were the only rooms available even though our reservation was confirmed 4 months in advance. He finally told us that he would give us two adjacent rooms the next day.  But the next day, Essam did the same thing again. He reassigned rooms to us but in two different sections again. We argued with him again but it was of no use. This man would try strongly NOT to help customers. Fortunately for us, there was one more person at the front desk and he tried to help us. His name was Ahmed. After listening to our request, he found out that there were two adjacent rooms available on a different floor and he assigned them to us. Our request was finally accommodated. Our first positive experience at this hotel was with Ahmed.   I had another weird experience at this hotel. I went to the restaurant on the roof top one day. Instead of directing me to a table, the waiter asked me, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù. I then asked him, ‚ÄúDo you have vegetarian food?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhat is vegetarian food?‚Äù I was stunned! He was a waiter at a restaurant and he didn‚Äôt even know what vegetarian food was. This place is obviously run by weird guys.  The only other positive experience was with the staff at the breakfast.

The breakfast were really good as well with a large selection of fruits meats pastries etc. Yes the ""rooms"" are not big but they are cabins not rooms, this is a Nile Boat not a hotel! The rooms were clean and everything worked.The staff were all amazing and tried their best, there were a few language issues as this is not a tourist establishment but frequented mostly by local people. We were always made to feel most welcome by the other guests and even joined in the festivities of a birthday party and an engagement party. the only complain was yes there is a smell of cigarette smoke in corridors etc but the is Egypt there is no such thing as a non smoking area.Would go back there again.‚Ä¶"

The staff is absolutely over the top polite, helpful and professional. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and the bathrooms are enormous with separate WC and bidet. Best of all though are the restaurants and downstairs lobby tea bar which transport you to another era. The Chinese restaurant (The name is 8)  was so excellent and the service was so incredible that we would‚Äôve eaten there every night but forced ourselves to explore other places, none comparable. Excellent designer shops also inside the hotel and fantastic concierge who helped us book some amazing tours and a sunset faluka boat tour with wine."

My room was facing the road opposing the zoo and there was a lot of noise at night. I had the impression that the balcony door was open. I was staying in a deluxe room but i saw no difference from the standard room, maybe more corridor room. The restaurant/bar at the pool wasn't great: they closed earlier than advertised and the drinks at the bar were awful. They don't know how to make a manhattan and the caipirinha was the worst i have ever had. Please also watch out: at check out, the desk person converted my Egyptian Pound invoice into USD and then proceeded to charge my credit card in GBP with a 4.5% markup without informing me. I pointed out to him that he was supposed to ask me in which currency i wanted to settle the bill, not decide for me. He tried to say that it was not him and that the machine automatically converted to GBP but i let him know that this was not teh first time i was checking out of a hotel with a credit card. Very dishonest and Unprofessional from a hotel of that standard. The 4.5% markup cost me an additional ¬£120. I don't know if the management told them to do this but it left me with a very bitter taste at the end of my stay.‚Ä¶"

It was directly across from the Cairo Zoo which was in terrible shape and detracted from the overall ambiance. We traveled during Covid and the security was pretty obvious even though the hotel was mostly empty. 
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d308077-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Cairo_at_Nile_Plaza-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,An excellent hotel with very comfortable rooms and very attentive staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the ambiance of the hotel. Great swimming pool with large deck area and food service.  Hotel has eight restaurants in which we dined and all of which have superb food and service. They had our room ready for our 5:30 AM arrival and provided late checkout to accommodate our late airline schedule. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about this great hotel.

Having stayed at a variety of FS properties all over the world, I would not hesitate to highly recommend this hotel to even the most seasoned FS customers.  Though the property itself may not be as fancy as some of the FS hotels in other locations, it was the staff who made our stay above and beyond our (already high) expectations of FS service. There was nothing too big or small that they couldn‚Äôt accommodate. The concierge was amazing with helping us book all of the tours, excursions, travel we needed assistance  with. And when we needed to fly back early from a day trip to Luxor because one of our family members was having a health issue related to the extreme heat, they took care of all of the logistics.  Cairo is a very overwhelming city that can have significant language and cultural barriers to the North American traveller and the FS Cairo Nile is there to help navigate and make sure your trip is amazing. I would not hesitate to recommend this property.‚Ä¶"

This is a review of The Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.   I stayed here last week for a couple of nights and everything was great. They were able to check me in early which was a bonus. I made use of the spa area and had a treatment, which was reasonably priced.   The outdoor pool area is a lovely oasis from the bustling and chaotic city, so I went down to the pool for a few hours a couple of times.   The restaurant for breakfast is spacious and has nice River views, and plenty of different options.   All staff were attentive and helpful."

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!

No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty.

The receptionist smiled when he found my card had lapsed some 14 years ago but my smiling request for a Nile view room was ignored as he is clearly not able to use his discretion for ‚Äúold friends‚Äù!! He did however offer my a rate on the daily breakfast that my agent had not sort to include in my booking ‚Ä¶. a good guy who went the extra mile!  Breakfast is a Bun Fight in the In and Out Cafe!! The receptionist very organised and one of the staff named Omnia a service ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the perfect staff member that we dearly loved to have in the days when I ran hotels myself  The breakfast restaurant clearly lacks organisation ‚Ä¶ in my four days here they have never ever managed to have sufficient fruit juices available to meet demand ‚Ä¶ it is a crying shame! The price charged for breakfast is substantial and the food offering and general service does not reflect that  We have also had a meal in the lobby cafe each evening of our stay ‚Ä¶ and here we see classic Egyptian management at work! When I opened restaurants in Egypt we found that one of the major hurdles was to teach managment to be proactive in quickly addressing guests needs and not expecting staff to do everything ‚Ä¶. I am easy on service because I understand but having to approach service staff and demand attention or serve myself my own drinks means that I have had enough!  I like this hotel and will return ‚Ä¶ it is so very easy to get to anywhere in Cairo and the Bell Captains help in securing me local taxi was everything as it should be. The front door service, reception desk and Omnia deserve full recognition!!!

No recognition of my Ambassador status. Disorganized check-in and check-out. They gave me a room that was not ready yet. The terrace bar of the hotel is simply dirty. The management of this hotel should be ashamed of the quality of the respect given to the customers. IHG should audit this hotel thoroughly.

The hotel is remodeled, the staff (especially Haremos and Waleed in the club lounge) were very attentive and friendly.   The ambassador club is also one of the best I‚Äôve seen, out of all the intercontinentales I‚Äôve visited. Only the one in Seoul is of the same caliber.

THE ROOMS ARE A BIT TIRED,  Doors does not close properly. They are very old and they have not been modernised.  The views are great overlooking the Nile and I could see the pyramids from my balcony.  Breakfast was good, but it was very busy and doesn't feel like a personal experience.  Some of the staff are stressed and some are pleasant.  Reception staff are good and helpful.  We had a room which was next to the lift shaft.  This room was very noisy all night and I had to fight to get it changed.  Overall, the experience is good but not excellent. "

All the people in general are extremely nice and helpful but he is much more. The hotel is not in the centre but it is only 20min far from the airport and it is in direct communication through the garage to the Citystars shopping centre, the biggest of Egypt. Thanks to this, you do not have to take a taxi to go to any restaurant, as inside the Citystars there is a wide choice of high level restaurants with very high ratings in Tripadvisor as well. Being the Staybridge the same family of Intercontinental, from the shopping centre you also have direct access to this other hotel where there are other excellent restaurants. Prices of restaurants are also much cheaper than staying anywhere else in the centre. In any tourist area prices are at least double. I did not give 5 stars because they need to improve breakfast service and quality. All the rest is really excellent, rooms are big, very confortable, very clean, they leave bottles of water every day, laundry is for free, beds are very confortable. Wifi works perfect. There is no swimming pool while the gym is very good. There is nothing outside the hotel and the area is not nice, but it is the standard in Cairo, as pollution and traffic are terrible, and quality of the buildings is extremely poor. The hotel is a gem in the area. The shopping centre closes at late night therefore in case of any need you find anything in there‚Ä¶"

You can walk through the lovely Intercontinental pool area (sister hotel next door) but you can‚Äôt use it. 2, no dedicated tour desk.

They take the Corona situation very serious (although quite some guests unfortunately don‚Äôt). The staff tries to enter the room as few times as possible. But if needed housekeeping can be requested.  Also because of Covid, guests that book a room with breakfast (or have it included) have a choice between room service or breakfast in the restaurant. There are no limitations on the breakfast options. The roomservice menu (dinner/ lunch) still has many options (more than other Hilton hotels worldwide during this pandemic). Rooms do have a classic interior, but all is really well maintained. The pool is located on the bank of the Nile, the only downside can be that it is sunny until around 1pm. I love the location in Zamalek, which is an area I like to wander around. The icing on the cake is the very friendly and helpful staff‚Ä¶. I can recommend this hotel fully and can‚Äôt wait to return here.‚Ä¶"

Lucky for us, the hotel is almost complete with their renovations and as a result, our rooms were amazing.  The website does not do the hotel enough justice.   In addition to this, the hotel staff had great security around the clock, prompt room assistance, excellent restaurants with many different food options, and is overall reasonably priced.    I give them my best recommendation."

It is a lovely hotel having  rooms with views of the Nile and a nice restaurant.  It is large so there is lots of room to wander and relax.  The management gave us a very late checkout without charge so we could catch a late flight to the US.  In the restaurant we were well taken care of by IMAN and the bell hop Ashfar made sure our Uber arrived on time and stayed with us until he arrived.

Thanks for Mr. Khalil from the swimming area for always setting up nice lounges in the shade close to each other as we were 10 people.   Room dining has improved significantly over the years. We ordered burger and chicken nuggets on multiple occasions. Always fresh with quality meat/ chicken. What you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

My husband and I are here for a few days prior to our Nile river cruise. Staff is extremely helpful at the dining areas, rooftop pool or just in the lobby areas. If you look confused they jump Right in to ask how they can assist you.   Restaurants - Middle eastern restaurant on the BR level was excellent - we had chicken soup, pigeons stuffed with rice etc. pigeons were a nice surprised with very dark meat but nicely spiced. E had a couple of tajines - but was way too much food for even the four of us.  SUGGESTION - Disclosing the portion size at ordering would help prevent food wastage. We felt bad at how much food we couldn‚Äôt eat. The restaurant on the R level was good for breakfast with representation of varied cultures. Ample types of food for people to decide what to eat. Pool bar - we came later in the day. Rooftop was clean with comfy lounges and couches. We had a couple of cocktails and some nibbles to watch the sun set.  Room COMFORTABLE BED! Slept really well. Soaker tub was appreciated and it helped me to wind down so I could sleep. Spacious bathroom. They stopped by and asked if we needed water.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d543043-Reviews-Cairo_World_Trade_Center_Hotel_Residences-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This place is by far THE worst ever. Everything was covered in dust in the room, we booked for a two week stay and unfortunately due to it being non refundable we had to live with the situation. Despite our daily complaints and reminders about how many guests are in the suite we never received the right amount of cutlery, the eggs were never cooked the way we asked which was simple ‚Äúwell done‚Äù it was always runny, the bathrooms were not clean at all, the balcony door would not shut completely, the window lock on one of the bedrooms would fall off as soon as we opened the window. These were not even the big issues.  We arrived on the 13th and today is the 22nd the water supply to the hotel was cut off. When we spoke to the staff/management they had claimed it was an issue with the main water supply of the area and not the hotels issue. We called a bunch of times to see if this was resolved and got no proper update.  We left the hotel to go out and before coming back we called in the afternoon to get an update and the status was that the water issue was not yet resolved and nobody went to clean the room yet. In the evening around 10:30 we called again and the hotel staff assured us the room was checked and cleaned and the water issue was resolved.   We got back to the hotel and went back to our suite, the whole apartment had water soaked into the fitted carpet. When we went down to speak to the  management they said they would change our suite for us which they did but  ended up being in an apartment suite  that was in worse condition in terms of cleanliness than the first one we stayed in!   There was dust everywhere the room looked like it was not used in a long time. There was dust on the toilet area, there was dirt and crumbs on the carpet, dust on shelves, the bedding in all three rooms had dust and hair on them. According to the staff the suite had been ‚Äúchecked‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù earlier in the day. We were surprised by how confident they were in claiming everything had been cleaned when clearly it was not!    It is now 1:30am and the staff are cleaning under our supervision! We are supposed to be on a relaxing holiday and instead this trip has been full of stress and irritation due to negligence by hotel staff and management.

It was a - 0000. The hotel pictures were falsely depicted online. I DO NOT recommend any international travelers to stay at this hotel. I PROMISE you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it certainly does not meet Covid protocol. It was unsanitary and management  and overall customer service was the WORST. We rented a suite to accommodate my family. We checked in at 4am in the morning and the complaints began as soon as we walked in. We ended our stay there by 11am. Total of 6 hours of disgust and poor hospitality. My cousin was locked into one of the bedrooms and we had to call the front desk from our cell phones since our hotel room phone was not working. It took them an hour to break down the door and get him out. The couches and dinning room chairs were stained, the carpet was stained and had lifted from the floor. The kitchen was not cleaned the stove had not been cleaned from the previous stay and was rusted and old. A loud electrical noise was coming from the kitchen that they couldn‚Äôt resolve and it lasted the entire time. The bathrooms were SCUM. Not cleaned. Toilets were stained and we could see scum and mold forming in all three bathrooms. No toilet paper, no clean towels, no soap‚Ä¶. Complete mess. I had initially reserved 3 nights and that quickly changed to a few hours. The manger that was the least bit helpful. I kept talking to her in English and she would respond in Arabic. She said she would not give us a refund that we would need to call Hilton hotline to complain. Although Hilton had said that the hotel would need to directly refund me. The hotel mgr mentioned they will be closing their doors anyways for remodeling in the next coming months. And she also said that since I spent more than a few hours in the hotel that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them to refund me. RIDICULOUS. This hotel needs to be reported to the Tourism Authorities really. Egypt is a beautiful and wonderful country full of hospitality and history and the people are full of heart and kindness. The hotel and management did not represent this country in any form or way. Shame on your Hilton World Trade.‚Ä¶"

The complimentary breakfast is same everyday and it‚Äôs not in international standard. The breakfast is not recommended for non-Egyptians.  2. There are 16 floors in this hotel and there is only one lift. You can imagine the wait time for the lift to come. Lift is always busy and we have to wait long to get the lift.  It‚Äôs better to stay in lower floor..  The lobby is not so clean as you can find lots of bees."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"If you live old world charm, this is the place. The bones are beautiful - a cage elevator, grand front doors,  worn marble steps, balconies, floor to ceiling windows. Lively,and very nicely decorated. Beds are good, great wifi and air con, and conveniently above shops that sell snack and cheap water. Also a great, walkable location (and easy to grab an Uber).  The glassed in bathrooms are a creative solution and quite lovely. But they are really only ideal for people who are okay seeing each other on the toilet. Maybe not for besties, or work colleagues, or your dad.  The arranged driver was lovely and waited when we were delayed at airport. And staff Wafaa deserves to be rewarded for her courtesy, attentiveness, and competence.    The only real downside, and the reason we only enjoyed 1 included breakfast, was being cornered for the hard-sell by owner Mustafa. He wanted to change our current plans and pressed us to go to his other property so he could redesign our whole trip. PUSHY. This was so annoying and rude that we have cancelled our plans to return to this hotel at the end of our trip. Just to avoid this dude. Really too bad.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is located very close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum, and a few other old downtown highlights. While the outside of the building looks slightly dilapidated--clearly beyond the control of the hotel--the entrance to the hotel and the interior is nicely done and inviting. Staff are very kind, helpful, and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and have the essentials. In the dining area, complementary tea and water are on offer throughout the day.  A few drawbacks: the street noise is very clearly heard from within the rooms (windows are not double paned), and Cairenes LOVE to honk for any and all reasons so you'll still feel very in touch with street life even within the hotel. Breakfast is rather mediocre: expect toast, hard boiled eggs, some jam, and a small cup of yoghurt, accompanied by tea or nescafe. The bedsheets are in serious need of updating (they are extremely rough and scratchy, making sleeping difficult). The bathrooms are an afterthought - just a corner in the room cordoned off by half-frosted glass, so it is recommended that you are very comfortable sharing all bodily functions with whomever you share the room. Despite a clear 'no smoking' sign at the front desk, staff still smoke in common areas (entry, dining area). We stayed in the room at the far end of the hallway (there are only six rooms) and could smell the smoke very clearly from inside our room with the door shut. When I went to pay for our room at checkout, one staff member sat directly in front of me smoking. I called him out on it, pointing at the 'no smoking' sign right in front of us, and he apologised profusely and moved away with his cigarette. I am 100% confident he resumed smoking inside as soon as we left.  Some of the basics aren't looked after: the room we were given had no pillowcases on three of our four pillows, and only one towel. The rest of the linens were out at the cleaners, and since there was only one person on staff, we had to stand in for the staff at the front desk so they could run out and pick up the clean linen. Rooms don't come with soap, but we were given a bottle of liquid soap when we asked. Early checkin is USD 25 on top of the regular room charge. The staff offered to arrange a car back to the airport on our departure, quoting a price double of what we paid to get from the airport to the hotel in the first place. It is recommended to just take an Uber instead (EGP 100-125, depending on traffic and time of day). Overall, it's not a bad hotel, and the staff's kindness goes a long way to compensate for the weaknesses noted above.‚Ä¶"

The staff, although small, is attuned to make your stay enjoyable.  The price is one class up from many of the small hotels downtown, but I found it to be secure and well situated.  You will be a $1 taxi ride from the current Egyptian Museum. Lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. My room was large with a great bathroom and shower, well lit."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We arrived at the hotel around 10.30 am, too early for check-in. Luckily, our room-to-be had been vacated and the bathroom cleaned, so we could use it and head out for a walk. Thanks to Achmed and Mustafa for that.  But I do not understand why they needed another two hours to get the room ready, when they did not even join the beds as we had requested a double bed at the time of booking or keep any towels when we returned close to 13:00. There were only hand/face towels kept, and even on the second day when we asked for bath towels, we got one, and were reluctantly asked, 'Do you need one more, I'll have to get it from the laundry.' Not being sure if he meant washed or unwashed laundry, we let it pass, lol. The shower fluctuates between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the staff tried their best to get it to work but it didn't, even on the second day. Add to it the tiny glass enclosure which they call a bathroom, there's no room to escape the hot and cold water, I almost got burnt! The glass cubicle idea is very weird, the frosting on the glass could have been complete near the toilet area at least! We stayed two nights, and were given two small bottles of water on the first day. When we asked on the second day, we were told it would be charged! When you check-in to a room, the least you expect is a hot shower, towels and water to drink. Sadly these were missing. The Wifi didn't work either. A special shout out to the lady in-charge of the cafe (I think her name is Ms. Wafa), she was very sweet and very efficient. The room itself was furnished well, with a nice wardrobe ideal for long stays. The two-rating is purely for the location and staff, and well the elevator! Grand Agor probably needs to decide if they want to be a hotel or a hostel. They are right now priced like a hotel with amenities like a hostel. There are much better cheaper places to stay in the downtown area, for once the Tripadvisor reviews did not match my experience, and I regret staying here.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12239092-Reviews-Grand_Agor-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"With the relentless chaos in Cairo, it‚Äôs important that you have a peaceful place to rest your head after a long day of exploring the city.   The hotel itself is quite new, which is great as the staff are always looking for feedback. The double room was very spacious with a lovely looking bathroom - unfortunately the hot water wasn‚Äôt too consistent so the showers could have been better. The bed was very comfortable, and there was a TV bracket on the wall but no TV. Unfortunately the WiFi was experiencing some issues during our stay so we didn‚Äôt have a great connection.   The hotel staff are just lovely; breakfast each morning was (as others have said) made with love, and the lovely lady would always offer us a tea or coffee when we were around. She really couldn‚Äôt do enough to take care of the guests and was one of our favourite parts of the hotel.   The location is also great, and central enough that you can pop back to use the toilet/have a coffee/take a breather from the Cairo madness, at any point during the day.   We arranged hotel pick up with the hotel after struggling to get in touch with them. If you do the same, make sure you go outside to meet your driver as only police are allowed inside the airport. Price was 25USD return which is very reasonable.   If we visit Cairo again we would stay at the Grand Agor - definitely recommend it.   The hotel also arranges tours for guests - we took one to the pyramids which was 20USD for both of us. Definitely do this. Avoid he public transport. Giza is hectic and stressful enough without waiting around for a bus! ‚Ä¶"

First off, do not let the entrance to the building where the hotel is distract you, it looks rough at best, but once you are inside the hotel, it is very nice. The staff is the friendliest you can find anywhere in the world, the rooms are wide and comfortable and  you get a feeling like you are staying at your friends house, and not actually at a hotel. Plus its location is very very good, right in downtown, near the museum, metro station, stores, etc. Last but not least the lift is very peculiar, not only is it very peculiar on the way it operates, but has its own theme music when moving, I know this sounds very odd, and it is, but for us it added a very special touch.‚Ä¶"

Its prime location in downtown allowed us to move freely in the area by foot or by public transport. Local restaurants were 5 minutes away, so is the Egyptian museum. The staff is super welcoming, professional and helpful. Every morning, our breakfast was made with love, by the lovely caretaker- Mrs Ouafa. Also, our room was spacious and very comfortable. Overall, it was a very nice hotel where price and comfort meets on the same level. We would highly recommend to those who wish to stay abit local and avoid the massive hotel chains.   **the hotel is actually located on the 2nd floor, so don‚Äôt be afraid to use the old lift!

Good to stay.  The hotel is far from the city center, do shopping is not easy.  The travel services to visit tourist spots provided by the Taxi booth of the hotel (named Last Minute travel services) was not up to the mark. The driver dropped me on the Egyptian museum and he was supposed to stay  at the gate. But when I come back visiting the museum, I did not find him. Then I called him and he declined the call. I sent him message , he responded sending message after half an hour without giving any specific time of coming. I was puzzled, waiting and waiting. Then I was thinking to hire another Taxi. Finally he came after more than an hour.   The services provided was also costly. I could hire a Taxi using the APP less than half price.  On the way back, it was planned to take me a super store for buying dry fruits. But  he did not took me to a right store. It was felt to me that he did it intentionally.‚Ä¶"

My kids were really happy with all of it. We also got breakfast boxes packed for us. Starting our trip here kicked off our Egypt explorations to a great start.

However, once we got to the room the story was a little different: we had a junior-suite, overlooking Tahrir Square, and off the bat our A/C was not working properly (specifically, the thermostat was not functioning, no matter what we changed the temperature to there was no change). The room also had an older smell, maybe even a smokey smell that was apparent each time you would walk in. The bathroom were huge and very clean, but had older fixtures with discoloration. Much of the room had this, in fact, with some parts of the ceiling having dry wall cracking and leaving little white crumbs around. Did any of this inhibit our experience? Not really, as the service makes up for it. But it's not exactly what I'd expect from The Ritz-Carlton. I'd like to give a final shout-out to Mina Aziz from Guest Relations: he made sure every request we had was fulfilled and even helped make some special cases work for us. Any future visits to Cairo would still have us staying here over any other option.‚Ä¶"

The gym is large with treadmills, ellipticals, and a plethora of weights and machines. We love a large gym and I will add extra time in the morning for this one. The breakfast is a huge display of every option you could imagine. The lobby piano is a nice way to enjoy their treats. Having a bank on sight helps when getting out cash and change. Enjoy your stay"

Food was a decent spread of international/ local cuisine and promptly served     **NEGATIVE** Now the bad  - ROOM ALLOCATION  Despite me asking around 2/3 times at check-in to have a room away from noise and any events they put me in a room right beneath the top bar.  Consequently every night at around 2AM loud music would reverberate into my room to the sounds of Despacito.  As you can imagine I asked if I could be moved again 2/3 times where they would answer let me get back to you and nothing happened.  For a work trip this is really not acceptable.  Did I also mention as well we saw a mouse run across the lobby!  - THIRD PARTY CHAUFFER On Wednesday last week we hired a car from the hotel from the ‚ÄòMUSTANG COMPANY‚Äô.  I had forgot my wallet in the car getting out which I realised 2 min entering my room.  Upon receiving it back from the driver I noticed all the money had been taken out (USD/AED).  I spoke to the managers Mr Hossam/ Ahmed right away who informed me they would investigate to no avail.    Their rationale it‚Äôs a third party company where there is nothing they can do.  Whilst I understand it would be very hard to prove, this is the RITZ not a 2 star BNB and they should use reputable providers.  In my 14 years travelling for work I‚Äôve never had anything like this which is a real shame.  Its important to highlight the facts above in case there are any other travellers who have experienced the same.‚Ä¶"

The sound is so high that seems the party is in your room. No body told me about that. Such a disrespectful with the clients. And the party is from people outside the hotel!

Very busy traffic outside, lots of garbage, people loitering, unsafe to walk around. The hallway going to our room was full of cigarette smoke, it was disgusting! There was ash next to our bed.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1635921-Reviews-Swiss_Inn_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"By far one of the worst hotels I've been to in my life. There is a problem with the rooms and service staff. We had to change rooms twice, the first room was dirty, a peice of the sink fell off in the middle of the night scaring us, and some furniture was missing.   The second room was a nightmare, the bathroom stunk of sewer and rotten egg and the AC leaked like a waterfall. We complained about the AC the night it started leaking, then again the next morning, then again during the afternoon. In the afternoon, housekeeping came and put a bucket under the AC to fix the problem. After complaining for the 4th time, the maintenance guy came and hit the AC with a broom as it was his way of repairing it. Of course this strategy did not work and the AC started leaking again at 11PM. We called the reception and maintenance and they only showed up to our room at 11:35 PM after 4 phone calls. The maintenance guy requested the reception to change our room as fixing the AC would take a lot of time, they refused. The maintenance workers started using machinery to fix the AC as we were in the room.  Finally they changed our rooms to a better one at almost 1AM because I was crying hysterically in the reception from exhaustion because I had a morning flight the next day.   Oh and they left a full trash bag (that was not ours) in front of the room for an entire night.  Please save yourselves the trouble a book another hotel.‚Ä¶"

It is in a green area with plenty of villas, quiet and peaceful, a relief to busy and dusty Cairo. It is fournished Laura Ashley style, and makes you realy nostalgic. We hoped to enjoy one of the two swimming pools and take a last sunbeam, but in this time of the year the pools are both in the shadow. We took diner in the evening in the beautiful garden near the pool. The food was delicious, but they don't have a wine card. They don't serve alcoholic drinks, but customers are allowed to bring bottles from outside the hotel, we saw several regulars with their own bottle at the table. Minus was the next morning, as we had to take an early flight and our breakfast was included in the price, I agreed with the staff in the lobby that they would bring it in the room before our departure.

The hotel is in a very nice part of Cairo, hard to reconcile the lushness here with the normal Egyptian scenery of sand dunes and camels. There are various embassies and institutes nearby and a big police presence which was reassuring The hotel itself is a colonial residence and quaint. Certainly, very different from the chains. The ambience within is that of a boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I was very happy with my room and the amenities. My only quibble was the wi-fi and not particularly comfortable work conditions The outside seating area is lovely to sit out the sunset. The pool is small but nice, but is in the dining area, and so you have limited access if you are working, so I had to make sure to return early to make use of it. Many of the reviews mention the food.  Out of necessity I are there all 3 nights I stayed. I found the food to be mediocre. I later stayed in other hotels nearby and found some brilliant places to eat and regret I was not more adventurous when I stayed at the Belle Epoque If I was being a tourist and not working, I would certainly recommend this hotel‚Ä¶"

But I saw the mix bag of reviews for Belle Epoque, I felt the need to chime in.  I am not a big hotel kind of a traveler. So, when I booked the flights to Cairo, I started looking. This was the only (or the only nice looking) boutique hotel I found. Some friends warned me Egypt doesn't do boutique hotels well, and yes, the reviews freaked me out a bit. But I couldn't bring myself to book one of those chain hotels... so I took a gamble.  It paid off. Really paid of!  The neighborhood is tree-filled, lush green, relaxed and quiet residential area loved by embassies and posh locals. Lots of nice restaurants, cafes, shops within walking distance. Locals told me they walk everywhere in this neighborhood. Many also told me they often come to Belle Epoque  for the pool, or for lunch.  You may spend your day in the hustle bustle of busy chaotic Cairo doing tourists stuff, so why not pick the most laid back beautiful villa to go back to relax at night? I loved Cairo, and I am definitely coming back. And when I am coming back, I will definitely stay here again.  PS: beautifully decorated spacious rooms, nice and friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"

Excellent Nile and Pyramids views from the room. Very spacious rooms with lounge and kitchen.  Beds were comfortable.  All the fixtures may not be perfect but the staff is very helpful and courteous. Hearty breakfast with the best Flafalls was included in our stay. The hotel very kindly oranised our pick up from the airport and organised an excursion  at a competitive price.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We (family of four) had made a reservation to stay for a night in Royal Galaxy Suites in early September 2018. The reservation was made over a month in advance. On the day when we arrived at the hotel, the receptionists stated that they had given the room to someone else as tried to debit the amount from the card but were unable to (this has never happened and I've used that card in over six countries including Egypt). They had sent a mail through booking.com to update card details but I was unable to access as I was traveling through the day.   They offered to send us to another hotel which was in a more remote part of town. When we arrived there, they stated that this would cost USD 90 instead of the USD 70 that was the original price. The rooms were of poor quality and they were just trying to take advantage of tourists who do not know the city well. We refused and moved out to find our own accommodation. They realized that we didn't take bait and within five minutes they sent the receptionist boy downstairs telling that the price was negotiable and that they would match the earlier price. However, we had decided to figure things out ourselves and walked out. These hotels use this as a business model to show fancy locations and rooms to customers and send you to another place (with a poorer quality) when you actually turn up. I also lost my faith in booking.com in allowing such hotels to operate. Never ever book in this hotel.‚Ä¶"
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The first impression when you arrive is that the place looks old and not well maintained. they shouldn't call it an hotel, it can be considered as guest house. The rooms are not well maintained and old.  However, the location itself is nice and the view to whole cairo is amazing. in addition, the friendly staff is very strong additive that compensates the negative things i found in this place."
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12233101-Reviews-Galaxy_Royal_Suites_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"I would have rated this 3.5 stars if I could, as 4 stars I think is too much...but 0.5 is not an option, so 3 stars is enough. The best thing about this hotel is ofcourse the view, wich indeed is great, with the Nile and also the pyramids (if you book a room with this view). We had a very nice feeling to stay in the balcony and watch the sunset. Also, the staff is polite and helped me to order some food and drinks that we ate in the balcony. Also you can buy sheesha and smoke it in the balcony. The room was spacious and clean. On the other hand there are some negative aspects also. The hotel itself is just a part of a big building, so only the 38'th and 39'th floors are for the hotel. The elevator looked a little bit shabby...Although clean, in the bathroom was a strong smell like a shop full of plastic china stuff (it was from the shower courtain); not that big of a problem, but still.  There is no restaurant like they say (at least on booking.com), but just a room with some tables to eat. The breakfast was quite poor, an omlette and some gem and the kitchen looked not very clean. Also no towels changed or cleaning the room in the morning. And sound proof not good. The idiot next room waked us up at 3 AM in the night because he banged the door and talked loud on the balcony... Poor wifi in our room.  All in all, it was an ok stay, great view, but a little too expensive for what you get. We paid 110 euros for 2 nights on the room with nile and pyramids view; I think a fair price would have been around 70-80 euros.‚Ä¶"

Anyways the duty manager there did nothing to help he said that he checked the cameras in corridors and no one had entered our rooms. To cut it short my rooms safe box at my arrival was not working and when i asked the receptionist to get it fix he came with a box full of keys and had reset it and left and the sexond day this happened.  Even the taxi we had asked to pick us took us directly to the way to airport while we hadn‚Äôt told them too so when we asked him he is going to the wrong way he said that the guy at the hotel said you are going to the airport as i think they thought we are going back home to our country.  This is just a bad experience but definitely true as we both friends in different rooms got some money missing from our saftey box.  Please be careful thats is my message.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d302715-Reviews-President_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"The hotel is in a good location and the room was clean, the bed comfortable. If you ask, you can get eggs cooked fresh for breakfast.  However, I requested a superior room because the room details stated that superior rooms have a balcony, and mine did not. This was very disappointing since this was the only reason I requested a superior room. Instead, it had a kitchenette which is strange and made it feel like a self contained apartment rather than a superior room in a hotel. I would have been better off with a regular room. Not long after I arrived, after waiting almost an hour past checkin time as the room was not ready, foul smelling water poured from an outlet under the sink, although I had not turned on the tap. The maintenance man did not listen when I explained where the water was coming from and that I had not turned on the tap, and instead fixed what would have been another problem had I done so, the broken pipe leading from the sink to the outlet above where the water came from. He also fixed a blockage which may have temporarily solved the mystery water issue. A young man came and carefully mopped the floor with antiseptic and clean water, but the smell lingered in the kitchenette for the duration of my stay, which fortunately was only one night.  When I went to have a shower I found the hot water was barely lukewarm, not matter how long I let the tap run for. There was no hot water in this room the entire stay.  Overall, it was overpriced for what I got, even for Zamalek.‚Ä¶"

The location of the hotel was perfect - there is a Starbucks and McDonald‚Äôs in walking distance. There is a bank to exchange money nearby and lots of cute little cafes too. The area is really safe and we would often go out late in the evening and had no issues. Would definitely recommend staying here.

The location is fantastic and in the heart of Egypt‚Äôs finest neighborhood, Zamalek. Within a walking distance, you will find countless shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, supermarkets and pharmacies. Literally everything you will ever need.  The hotel has some nice bars and restaurants. For a hotel this size, I was surprised they have some good options for a drink or a meal.  The room is small but very clean and you wouldn‚Äôt need it much if you are planning to move around.   Staff are generally very helpful and polite which is again something you might not find in 5-star hotels around Cairo.  Now when it comes to the cons of this hotel. It will be the elevator which is very slow and tiny so if the hotel is busy, you will suffer a bit.  Also, there‚Äôs no soundproofing system so you can hear everything happening next door but the managers were very supportive to control this.  I will definitely be staying here again.‚Ä¶"

They said okay no prob but there is a cancellation fee which is 122$, so If you want you can stay the night and pay the fee so you won‚Äôt lose it.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d3412402-Reviews-The_Gabriel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"This review is regarding day use at the Gabriel hotel pool.  I have been here more than 20 times for day use and ive spent the night 4 times and used to be a big fan. But since Andrew left its gone down the toilet. First of all we booked through the whatsapp booking. They asked for photo i.d of all my friends that wanted to come. Kind of ridiculous. Then they wanted all our facebook accounts. Presumably to check we dont look ugly or poor. Again ridiculous, this is a swimming pool not Studio 54. We are two couples in our 30s40s. We should not have to show a stupid social media presence to enter a pool. On arrival they told us that the reservation was to reserve attendance not to reserve sunbeds. That's not what a reservation is. So there were no umbrellas left and not enough sunbeds for our group (3 present and 2 joining later). There was one double bed left right next to the showers and speakers - least desirable spot. We asked for a spare sunbed to be bought over and put beside our bed as we are a group of 5. They refused. Said it was too difficult and just kept repeating ""no way"" because according to the obnoxious attendance the beds fit 7 people. The bed was the width of 3 pillows meaning if three people laid side by side like sardines they could fit, but not comfortably. I can guarantee no egyptian woman would be expected to be 7 to a sunbed but screw the white chicks they can suck it up? After an extended argument they put a sunbed next to the double bed which was no difficulty at all. We then asked for the spare umbrella but they refused saying the umbrellas that were ironically on wheels could not be moved. We had driven a long way so chose to stay, but without any shade we left after 3 hours. We would have liked to spend the day - the hottest day of the year so far. Its also important to mention that the dj blasts annoying house music too loud. They wont turn it down. This has been a problem on another visit when we were the only family at the pool and they still wouldnt turn it down a fraction. We couldn't talk  side by side without shouting.  Also on another visit when we had to be vetted on our facebook to make sure we were not scumbags there were people so ridiculously drunk they vomitted in the pool. We reported it to the waiter who went over to have a word and walked away with their drinks order! Its gotten gradually worse, but this visit really was the limit. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.‚Ä¶"

The hotel itself is a party for Egiptian people: starting in the pool (where you can‚Äôt simply relax because of the noise of ‚Äúthe music‚Äù - arabian reggeton‚Ä¶ later on the party continues in the ‚Äúrestaurant area‚Äù which is exactly in the middle of the hotel, so you can easily hear the excesively loud music from your room till very after the midnigth‚Ä¶  The breakfast is poor, and defficient quality. People attending the tables don‚Äôt speak english, and what you get isn‚Äôt frequently what you really ordered.  We choosed this hotel because of it‚Äôs nearby the airport, and it‚Äôs side by side to a big shopping mall (SunCity) which is mostly dead (5 floors and only very very few shops open).  Deffinetly I do not recommend this property unless you are looking for bad rest, egiptian partys all the time, bad food and a barely dead surrounding.  FAR, VERY FAR FROM A 5 STARS‚Ä¶ run away!‚Ä¶"

The minute We pulled up  to the property We were greeted at the car with the bell man waiting to collect our bags and guide us to the front desk. Izzy who works at the front desk, had everything ready and waiting for our arrival, she was 10 steps ahead lol and I can appreciate that. Thank you Izzy!! They try their best to accommodate your requests. 5/5 for customer service and staff. Cleanliness of the room 5/5 and comfort 5/5. Did not like that the bar was close for the nights we stayed there so that really was our only con about our stay. I definitely recommend the Gabriel, two thumbs up!"

It is in a very bad location, the view of the rooms are just not finished construction sites, it is beside a decadent shopping mall, far far away from the city. The room itself with stained bed linen, all the water from the faucets were dark brown, hairs in the pillows, stains in the carpet.  There was also a party in the main restaurant with loud music that we could listen in our rooms. Horrible!"

This excellent hotel is part of a Supermall in the up n coming section of ‚ÄúNew Cairo‚Äù. It allows some window shopping, as many stores are empty, where the affluent Egyptians partake and has an interesting food court if the two restaurants remain closed as during our stay.  15 minutes taxi from airport and an interesting location for those not interested in venturing into Cairo, it combines top notch service with an eclectic and curious ambiance. All the comforts and conveniences you have likely missed during your Egypt tour, await you here. We missed out on the restaurant review as it was closed for a private event (unusual) but the room service was excellent and delicious."

If you want to stay in same-same sterile modern international standard accommodation, you wouldn‚Äôt choose the Lotus Hotel. If, however, you seek old-world charm (without the fancy makeover that has arguably spoilt so many of the old-world hotels in Egypt), the Lotus is a really great choice. The rooms are simply furnished, very clean, & very adequate. The highlight of the hotel is the staff, who are wonderfully kind, helpful, welcoming, & 100% genuine in their care of their guests. The hotel is in a great downtown location, with plenty of local caf√©s, bars, restaurants, & shops in easy walking distance. I stayed at the Lotus on 3 occasions during my recent visit to Egypt. It will be my preferred choice on my next visit too. ‚Ä¶"

As a single and first-time traveler to Cairo, it was the perfect place to stay for a week, and understand what daily life is like. I was able to walk to so many places once I felt confident with the rhythm of the streets (thanks to Samir Fayek). This place has so much character and warmth to share even if it's not a ""luxurious"" hotel. (Personally, I'm more interested in the depth and a story -- if you're looking for that, you will find it here. ) Ayman, Emad, Abeer, Ibrahim, and Adel (and others that I know I'm forgetting, sorry!) made me feel so welcome and couldn't have been more gracious. On my next trip to Egypt, no matter where I am, I will go out of my way to return to Lotus to say hello to everyone there. Mr. Wafik Doss (owner of the hotel) is a gem and a true professional in the world of hospitality, and I will continue to stay at his hotels in the future when I'm back in Cairo. Mr. Doss kindly introduced me to Mina and Samir Fayek (tour guide experts) that I highly recommend using if you're staying at Lotus or Windor. (They've been working together for ~40 years.) Wafik and the Fayek Tour Guides work from their hearts; I was lucky enough to experience it and will be forever grateful.‚Ä¶"

The hotel has been around some time, having survived the ups and downs of the tourism industry. It offers good value for money and the staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak English - some well. The beds are comfortable and the hotel gives a choice of western or Egyptian breakfast included in the very reasonable rates. I liked the manager very much and found him very helpful during the difficult 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. I almost had to stay on after the Cairo airport closed and would have felt safe there for weeks if that had happened. The hotel is well located too - close to Tahrir Square, the Egyptian Museum and many restaurants and other amenities."

It's a ten minute walk to the museum and plenty of eating options close by.  The hotel is an old time kind of place but I liked it. It had character.  The people who worked there also were friendly and and good banter. There is a bar upstairs where you can get a beer and chill out after the sightseeing during the day.  If any criticism maybe the breakfasts could be better. However for the price and the quality of the rooms ,mine with a balcony I found the place to my liking.  If I ever go back it will be there. Or possibly the Windsor hotel the one I should of been in which is the sister hotel closed for now. Keep up the good work guys.  We will return one day !!"

We decide to stay in the Hotel then. The bar, restaurant, room, are very good. Welcome and service too. Very good security. For me it's a very good place to stay in Cairo. After my trip in Assouan, Louxor and Alexandria I booked one more time 4 nights in Lotus Hotel Resturant. We were very happy to come back. We eat very good kochery and very good spaghetti.

It dates to 1950 and has had no major renovation since then. For those on a budget and who are familiar with 1 and 2 star hotels, the Lotus is a great choice. This means weak WiFi, iffy plumbing, thin towels, and simple bkfst. It has a fun bar, a restaurant, they'll do laundry, and you can walk to downtown sites. Some devoted foreign guests (it has its fans) but mostly Egyptian. The bar has a hipster on a budget vibe."

Good location with comfortable bed and a convenient airport pick up. That said the floor blackened our feet, the curtains had a strange smell and without a shower curtain or mat the small bathroom always had a wet floor. The pictures I think are very dated as the common seating area has seen a lot of traffic, is dusty, uncomfortable and not a pleasant place to have the breakfast of bread, jam and cheese.

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1799808-Reviews-Traveler_s_House_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,Right in the heart of the chaos of Cairo.  Good accommodation provided for the price that was paid.  The room and shared bathroom were clean and everything worked as it should.  There are heaps of great places to eat close by the hotel and the staff can offer suggestions on where to try.  The included breakfast was basic but adequate.  The included wi-fi was a bit hit and miss but this was the same all over Egypt.  The staff were professional and friendly.  They had offered us free pick up from the airport but unfortunately when we arrived there was no one there to meet us.  Apparently they organised it for the wrong time.  We booked a tour of Giza through them for a reasonable price.  All in all we were happy with the service provided and would stay here again.
https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d1799808-Reviews-Traveler_s_House_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"We had a 3-day stay at this hostel after reading many great reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel staff were knowledgeable about the area and were able to recommend some favourite local restaurants. I wasn't too keen on having a shared bathroom, but the rooms with a private bathroom were sold out when we booked.  The room was clean and simple when we arrived. There was an armoire for us to store our clothing. The A/C had a bucket to collect drips underneath, but this was never a problem. There were two shared bathrooms to use and they were kept clean and stocked with toilet paper. During our stay, we never had issues with the bathrooms being occupied when we needed them. The common room has books to borrow, and satellite TV, but no A/C. Despite our room overlooking a busy street (during Ramadan), we didn't find the noise to be too loud. Unlimited fresh towels were provided, and Wifi is free (and signal strength good) in all rooms.  You can't beat the hotel location. It is so central that you don't need a taxi to visit the shopping district (July 26th street and Ataba Market), many restaurants, and several attractions (Tahrir Square, Museum, Nile Corniche). The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Ramses Train Station which was very convenient for us.‚Ä¶"

Their rooms and bathrooms are basic and also clean.  The owner and his staffs are all good people to talk to. And they are willing to help and give advice on anything relating to having a good time in Cairo or Egypt.  They can arrange airport transfers and if you book atleast a certain number of nights, you will get a free transfer.   Location wise is in downtown, busy area and don't have to worry about safety late at night as the area is always filled with people. You can hear traffic from the room, so prepare earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  There are lots of restaurants to eat at and there is a confectionery right opposite the hostel.  I got a free upgrade to a room with 4 beds and attached bathroom despite booking for single bed shared bathroom.  In all, I recommend this hostel for budget travellers.‚Ä¶"

The host Adel and the staff Jasmine are super kind and helpful.  Jasmine is not just a worker there but becomes one of my best foreign friends, she took me to the famous traditional Koshary restaurant and even cooked for me the night before I left.    This is not a high-class hotel, but definitely a warm place if you want to make some friends and take rest.  The location is also very nice, you can easily grab the best dessert downstairs because the best El Abd is just across the street from travelers house.  It only takes around 10-15 mins by walk to the museum as well.  The only thing I would expect more is that they can refinish the room if they plan to make something different.  Some of the furnitures and facilities are not quite new.  But for a backpacker like me, this is still a nice place to stay.‚Ä¶"

Also, the hotel may accept foreigners but it doesn't cater to them - forget about getting a drink of anything with alcohol in it, and forget about even getting a glass to your room if you plan to self-cater. The hotel only has plastic and paper disposable dixie cups ! They have no ice buckets and the best I could get was a plastic bag full - the place has no class of any kind.

Pros: Perfect location in the middle of Midan Tahrir with a magnificent view of the square from my room window  Friendly staff from the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping. Large room and electric kettle and bottled water supplied daily. The hotel is connected to La Poire one of Cairo's better known cafes.  Cons: Rooms are tired and in desperate need of renovation with stained carpets. The bathroom leaked from both the sink and the shower. The drain in the shower didn't work and flooded the bathroom everytime I took a shower. Breakfast was basic and tasteless.  This hotel is not  cheap for the mediocre quality it offers  and  needs renovation soon. Just to add that the clientele was mainly Arab from various Arab countries with some Westerners and Africans.‚Ä¶

Aside from one person in the reception, the others were terrible. The one who greeted me in was unwelcoming. After taking my passport information and charging my card, he got a personal phone call and he stepped away leaving me there standing for several minutes without any information from the room or other. When he came back, he rudely said that the bellman would guide me to the room. Staff definitely needs urgent training on manners, politeness and being welcoming in general. Breakfast was terrible. Don't bother to book this hotel with breakfast (they offer a pre-packaged version that is not fresh at all). It is better to go to the small cafe place on the corner that provides excellent options."

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,The correct way to advertise Nile View hotel would be. Stay in a -5 star old rundown boat watching toxic waste dumping in the river. With an old rustic black mold infested carpet and mold in sink and shower and for entertainment staff entering your room late at night. And for a bonus get sick from the food and stay on the toilet looking at the Mold in the sink and shower. And for your safety in the event of an emergency there is a dirty old mattress in the hallway that you can hide under to keep you safe from predators. This is an experience of a lifetime. You can book this exciting holiday on Nile View deceptive website. Nile View hotels advertising is very misleading. It‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel it's a nothing star disgusting filthy old rundown boat that was so bad we both got very sick from the deplorable conditions. There is black mold everywhere in the carpet on the walls in the sink on the floors this was the most disgusting rundown hotel we have ever stayed at. And even the ceiling was falling apart. We witnessed hotel employees dumping toxic waste in the Nile. This hotel should not be allowed to be open as it is a health hazard. Our stay on the dirty old boat was a nightmare. Just read the numerous negative reviews and look at actual pictures posted by myself and others that stayed at Nile View they tell the truth. And no matter what lies Nile View post it does not change this fact ‚Ä¶

They canceled my reservation on Nile view side without any notice or warning, and give it to foreign guests instead of me, then tried to convince me to accept port view instead of Nile view. The duty manager was very rude person, he gives me his back while talking, and left me with no options rather than leaving the place. Not recommended at all."

I enjoyed very much my stay with German group of 20 who nearly cancelled their booking from Feb, 28 till Mar. 02, 2020 only because we discovered that this great boat relocated in Maddi and still not open.  Instead, boat management was thoughtful enough to arrange for an A/C brand new shuttle bus dialy! First we thought this is only to & from the museum only. But we were mostly pleased to discover that this thoughtfulness extents to every where, any time and any numbers of time! Thoughtfulness is reflected in staff attitude as well! We and the owner are really lucky to have this staff who LOVE the boat, love their work and care soooooo much for customer satisfaction. I barely had the chance to order anything! They care enough to fullfil every need and any remark before you even say it!!  Nile view Zamalek (now Maadi): you made me proud, you made all the guests happy, you gave us such a wonderful experience that I want really to thank each and every one of you. I can't believe how caring, clean and kind every one of you are! It's not just hospitality it's true kindness & care coming from professional people who received us befoooooore getting readying and finishing innovations! But they really made a ""hard to please group"" ; feel home. Can't thank you enough, we will sure be back to see you after renovations After special entrance gate is finished. After sundeck and covered pool are ready  Food there is unforgettable! I had the most wonderful kabsa, the best hawawshy and an amaaaazing mixed grill. Breakfast buffet is memorable! Oh my God! What great bakery do they have!!! Best omlette in town! Tameya is fried before you. All kinds of hot drinks! Real fresh orange juice. Real care and morning smile. Even if you are in a hurry, they would notice and make you the best snacks to go! O my God after 2 days I'm still overwhelmed with your kindness people! I remember each and every name of you: Reception: Ahmed, Sheriff Mostafa & Adel. Room service: Refaat Food and beverage: Nabieh Omlette stand: Hamad (very caring) Chief at the kitchen is the best (not sure about the name) Even room cleaning: Maha Bill man. Security men who would help you park your car. Everyone .. I'm sorry I haven't met you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Can't wait till I'm back.‚Ä¶"

https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g294201-d12636131-Reviews-Nile_View_Jewel_Hotel-Cairo_Cairo_Governorate.html,"Please note that this hotel would not keep any rooms for you even after they confirm you that a room (or rooms) is reserved for you. They just look at the rooms available when you check in and assign one of the available rooms to you. They just don‚Äôt care if the available room is not of the type you requested.  We reserved two rooms for 3 nights and requested that they should be next to each other. The hotel staff acknowledged and sent me an email with confirmation numbers. This happened 4 months before our stay. But still, when we checked in, they gave us rooms in two different sections of the hotel. Essam (not sure how it is spelt) was at the front desk and he was extremely uncooperative. He was adamant that those were the only rooms available even though our reservation was confirmed 4 months in advance. He finally told us that he would give us two adjacent rooms the next day.  But the next day, Essam did the same thing again. He reassigned rooms to us but in two different sections again. We argued with him again but it was of no use. This man would try strongly NOT to help customers. Fortunately for us, there was one more person at the front desk and he tried to help us. His name was Ahmed. After listening to our request, he found out that there were two adjacent rooms available on a different floor and he assigned them to us. Our request was finally accommodated. Our first positive experience at this hotel was with Ahmed.   I had another weird experience at this hotel. I went to the restaurant on the roof top one day. Instead of directing me to a table, the waiter asked me, ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù. I then asked him, ‚ÄúDo you have vegetarian food?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúWhat is vegetarian food?‚Äù I was stunned! He was a waiter at a restaurant and he didn‚Äôt even know what vegetarian food was. This place is obviously run by weird guys.  The only other positive experience was with the staff at the breakfast. They were all nice and friendly.‚Ä¶"

Well I am glad that we stuck with our plan, the location is perfect, views of the Nile in the evening are stunning we ate all our meals for the two days we were there in the restaurant and we couldn't fault anything. The breakfast were really good as well with a large selection of fruits meats pastries etc. Yes the ""rooms"" are not big but they are cabins not rooms, this is a Nile Boat not a hotel! The rooms were clean and everything worked.The staff were all amazing and tried their best, there were a few language issues as this is not a tourist establishment but frequented mostly by local people. We were always made to feel most welcome by the other guests and even joined in the festivities of a birthday party and an engagement party. the only complain was yes there is a smell of cigarette smoke in corridors etc but the is Egypt there is no such thing as a non smoking area.Would go back there again.‚Ä¶"

Upon check-in, I was greeted and taken care of in a very personalized manner.  They had an upgrade available, and put me in a suite overlooking the Nile River.  I was escorted to the concierge, who offered me an itinerary of activities during my stay in Cairo, and then was shown to my suite.  The suite itself was amazing! It was fully stocked with plenty of bottles of water, and there was a bouquet of roses with a hand-written note along with some welcome snacks, and a personalized dessert congratulating me for a recent accomplishment.  Soon after getting settled in, there was a knock on the door and my personal butler came in to introduce himself to me, and inform me of the services he was able to provide to me. I was able to experience the gym, spa, outdoor pool, and a restaurant during my stay at the St. Regis Cairo, and was impressed with each new experience.

The special Thanksgiving menu at J&G was a truly elevated interpretation of classic dishes. The pumpkin soup, stuffed turkey and pumpkin pie and ice cream were superb, and the hanging crystal ambiance was lovely.  The St Regis Cairo beautifully blends classic Astor Art Deco with Middle Eastern and Asian touches that are a feast for your eyes, and the steakhouse, Singaporean and Italian restaurants are exquisite. The duck and tangerine chicken at Tianma are particular favorites, as is the clay pot gnocchi sorrentina at La Zisa.   Hand-hammered lanterns of every cultural influence decorate common areas and rooms. The indoor heated pool was perfect, and you have wonderful views of the Nile throughout the hotel.‚Ä¶"

The staff is absolutely over the top polite, helpful and professional. The rooms are spacious, well appointed and the bathrooms are enormous with separate WC and bidet. Best of all though are the restaurants and downstairs lobby tea bar which transport you to another era. The Chinese restaurant (The name is 8)  was so excellent and the service was so incredible that we would‚Äôve eaten there every night but forced ourselves to explore other places, none comparable. Excellent designer shops also inside the hotel and fantastic concierge who helped us book some amazing tours and a sunset faluka boat tour with wine."

My room was facing the road opposing the zoo and there was a lot of noise at night. I had the impression that the balcony door was open. I was staying in a deluxe room but i saw no difference from the standard room, maybe more corridor room. The restaurant/bar at the pool wasn't great: they closed earlier than advertised and the drinks at the bar were awful. They don't know how to make a manhattan and the caipirinha was the worst i have ever had. Please also watch out: at check out, the desk person converted my Egyptian Pound invoice into USD and then proceeded to charge my credit card in GBP with a 4.5% markup without informing me. I pointed out to him that he was supposed to ask me in which currency i wanted to settle the bill, not decide for me. He tried to say that it was not him and that the machine automatically converted to GBP but i let him know that this was not teh first time i was checking out of a hotel with a credit card. Very dishonest and Unprofessional from a hotel of that standard. The 4.5% markup cost me an additional ¬£120.

Having stayed at a variety of FS properties all over the world, I would not hesitate to highly recommend this hotel to even the most seasoned FS customers.  Though the property itself may not be as fancy as some of the FS hotels in other locations, it was the staff who made our stay above and beyond our (already high) expectations of FS service. There was nothing too big or small that they couldn‚Äôt accommodate. The concierge was amazing with helping us book all of the tours, excursions, travel we needed assistance  with. And when we needed to fly back early from a day trip to Luxor because one of our family members was having a health issue related to the extreme heat, they took care of all of the logistics.  Cairo is a very overwhelming city that can have significant language and cultural barriers to the North American traveller and the FS Cairo Nile is there to help navigate and make sure your trip is amazing. I would not hesitate to recommend this property.‚Ä¶"

This is a review of The Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.   I stayed here last week for a couple of nights and everything was great. They were able to check me in early which was a bonus. I made use of the spa area and had a treatment, which was reasonably priced.   The outdoor pool area is a lovely oasis from the bustling and chaotic city, so I went down to the pool for a few hours a couple of times.   The restaurant for breakfast is spacious and has nice River views, and plenty of different options.   All staff were attentive and helpful."
